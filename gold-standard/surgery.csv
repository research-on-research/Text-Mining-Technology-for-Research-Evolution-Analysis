"2";"Wound-healing complications following body contouring for massive weight loss patients are significant, with rates exceeding 40 percent. To better understand aberrant healing in this population, the authors have performed a comparative analysis of the wound milieu literature for patient populations with similar complication rates. PubMed and Ovid databases were reviewed from January of 1985 to January of 2009 for key terms, including wound healing, obesity, cancer, burn, transplant, and body contouring. Serum and wound levels of multiple factors, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines, were assessed. Complication rates in body contouring surgery range from 31 to 66 percent. Sixty-five studies were reviewed, and wound-healing complication rates were identified for cancer (45.8 percent), burn (30.4 percent), posttransplant (36 percent), and obese (43 percent) populations. In these groups, matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) help regulate wound repair. Matrix metalloproteinase levels were elevated in cancer (4-fold increase in MMP-2), burn (20- to 30-fold increase in MMP-9), transplant (1.4-fold increase in MMP-2), and obese/chronic (79-fold increase) populations. TIMPs were increased in cancer (1.9-fold increase in TIMP-2) and burn (1.4-fold increase in TIMP-1) patients but decreased in chronic wound (55-fold decrease in TIMP-1) populations. Alterations to these regulatory proteins lead to prolonged matrix degradation, up-regulation of inflammatory mediators, and decreased growth factors, delaying the wound-healing process. Complications after body contouring surgery are likely multifactorial; however, molecular imbalances to the massive weight loss wound milieu may contribute to poor surgical outcomes. Examining wound regulatory proteins including transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinases could aid in understanding the healing difficulties observed clinically."
"3";"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is growing in popularity in the United States. A rare late complication is obstruction at the level of the band, with concentric gastric pouch dilation. In our patient, endoscopy showed gastric pouch dilation with food impaction and a restricted outlet. We describe the combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach for alleviation of chronic obstruction as a late complication of an adjustable gastric band. This combined approach included laparoscopic band removal and scar excision with intraoperative endoscopic dilation."
"2";"Obesity is a problem that is reaching epidemic proportions throughout the world and bariatric surgery is now a rapidly growing technique. However existence of obesity in humans has been recognized for thousands of years, as statues dating from the Stone Age period appear to provide the earliest depictions. Hippocrates (466-355 b.C.) and Galen (131-201 a.C.) had a clear understanding of the condition, its consequences and medical treatment. On the other hand bariatric surgery was a xx century treatment, but at the end of the xix century it was known that the massive loss of small bowel or gastric resection after ulcer surgery resulted in persistent weight loss. Malabsorption and gastric restriction in isolation, or more commonly in combination, remain the main options to surgical control of weight. Unfortunately surgery as a non etiological treatment is an imperfect model to treat an incurable disease: morbid obesity. Prevention and better knowledge of disease would allow a tailored medical or surgical approach."
"3";"Management of patients with total intestinal aganglionosis (TIA) is a medical challenge because of their dependency on parenteral nutrition (PN). Intestinal transplantation (ITx) represents the only alternative treatment for patients with irreversible intestinal failure for achieving intestinal autonomy. Among 66 patients who underwent ITx in our center, 12 had TIA. They received either isolated ITx (n = 4) or liver-ITx (LITx, n = 8) after 10 to 144 months of total PN. All grafts included the right colon. After a median follow-up of 57 months, the survival rate was 62.5% in the LITx group and 100% in the ITx patients. The graft survival rate was 62.5% in the LITx group and 75% in the ITx group. All the surviving patients were fully weaned from total PN, after a median of 57 days. Pull through of the colon allograft was carried out in all patients. Fecal continence is normal in all but one of the surviving children. These results suggest that ITx with colon grafting should be the preferred therapeutic option in TIA. Early referral to a transplantation center after diagnosis of TIA is critical to prevent PN-related cirrhosis and thereby to permit ITx, which is associated with a good survival rate."
"3";"There is a growing need for clinically applicable body composition assessment tools for extremely obese individuals. The objective of this research was to evaluate several bioimpedance techniques for monitoring changes in fluid, particularly intracellular water (reflecting body cell mass) after bariatric surgery. Fifteen extremely obese women (body mass index: 48.9+/-7.0 kg/m(2); age: 48+/-9 years) were assessed before (baseline; T1), and approximately 6 weeks after gastric bypass surgery (T2) by several multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis approaches (MFBIA; QuadScan 4000), a bioimpedance spectroscopy device (BIS; Hydra 4200), and multiple dilution. BIS provided intracellular water estimates that were comparable to criterion, based on mean comparisons, at both time points (T1: criterion: 24.2+/-3.1L, BIS: 24.0+/-3.7 L; T2: criterion: 20.6+/-3.7 L, BIS: 19.7+/-3.2L). MFBIA (with Deurenberg equations) provided comparable measures to criterion only at T2 (criterion: 20.3+/-3.7L, MFBIA: 20.6+/-2.7 L). Both MFBIA (with QuadScan proprietary equations) and BIS produced estimates of intracellular water change that were comparable to dilution. There was substantial variability in individual volume measures. Although MFBIA and BIS hold promise as convenient techniques for assessing fluid changes, individual variability in measurements makes them impractical for assessment of extremely obese patients in the clinical setting."
"3";"To compare and describe the weight loss outcomes from gastric bypass and gastric band so as to define the variation of excess weight loss (EWL) among individual patients, the time to onset of effect, and the durability of weight loss in severely obese adults. Gastric bypass and gastric band are the most common operations for obesity performed in the United States, but few reports have compared these 2 procedures. Patients (N = 1733, aged 18-65 years) met National Institutes of Health criteria for obesity surgery and underwent either gastric bypass or gastric band between March 1997 and November 2006. The selection of bypass versus band was based on patient/surgeon discussion. The evaluable sample consisted of 1518 patients. The percentage of EWL was assessed over 2 years. Successful weight loss was defined a priori as > or = 40% EWL in each of four 6-month postoperative measurement periods. The analyses included a mixed model and generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with repeated measures. Odds ratios and descriptive analyses were also provided. Gastric bypass was associated with less individual variation in weight loss than gastric band. Both procedures were associated with a significant EWL benefit (Treatment Group effect P < 0.0001), but they differed in terms of time to effect (Treatment Group x Period interaction effect P < 0.0001). The mean EWL for gastric bypass was greater at each measurement period (6, 12, 18, 24 months) compared with gastric band (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, at each of the postoperative measurement periods within each treatment group (bypass and band), the mean EWL was greater for those who had preoperative body mass index (BMI) < or = 50 kg/m2 than for those who had preoperative BMI > 50 kg/m2 (P < 0.0001). Gastric bypass was consistently associated with a greater likelihood of at least a 40% EWL in each of the 6-month postoperative measurement periods (GEE, P < 0.0001). The odds ratio estimates at months 6, 12, 18, and 24 were 18.2, 20.6, 15.5, and 9.1, respectively. Despite these clinically meaningful outcome differences, nearly all (> or = 93%) bypass and band patients who had > or = 40% EWL at 6, 12, or 18 months postoperatively maintained at least this level of success at 2 years. Gastric bypass produced more rapid, greater, and more consistent EWL across individuals over a 2-year postoperative period than gastric band."
"3";"Many different remedial operations for alkaline reflux gastritis have been described. Analysis of their efficacy is difficult, because while many of the procedures have good early results, there are long-term failures due to their own complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate our experience with patients undergoing remedial operations for alkaline reflux gastritis syndrome. The clinical features and results of remedial operations of 65 patients with alkaline reflux gastritis syndrome were reviewed retrospectively. Data on the hospital course were collected by interviewing patients directly or by telephone contact. An assessment of each patient's response to remedial operation was then made and a Visick score assigned. All patients had been tried on a medical treatment and dietary restriction or both prior to remedial operation. Long-term follow up was possible in 46 patients. Seventy-six percent of patients who at the final state had a truncal vagotomy, distal gestrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy have been found to show satisfactory results (Visick-I/Visick II). Three patients who had previously undergone a Roux-en-Y conversion later required re-operation for Roux-stasis syndrome and a near-total gastrectomy was performed on these patients. Other operations performed for alkaline reflux gastritis were converted to ""uncut"" Roux-en-Y in five patients and dismantling of gastrojejunostomy in two patients. For patients unresponsive to medical treatment, we reccommend the following strategy: a) for patients with truncal vagotomy plus gastrojejunostomy, dismantling of gastrojejunostomy should be the first choice b) for patients with prior Billroth-II gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y conversion is the most effective corrective operation, although it has its proper including Roux statis syndrome."
"3";"The primary objective of this study was to assess the validity of body mass index (BMI) in predicting percent body fat and changes in percent body fat with weight loss in bariatric surgery patients. Twenty-two bariatric patients (17 female, five male) began the study designed to include 12 months of testing, including data collection within 1 week presurgery and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postsurgery. Five female subjects were lost to the study between 6 months and 12 months postsurgery, resulting in 17 subjects (12 female, five male) completing the 12 months of testing. Variables measured in the study included height, weight, percent fat (% fat) by hydrostatic weighing, lean mass, fat mass, and basal metabolic rate. Regression analyses predicting % fat from BMI yielded the following results: presurgery r = 0.173, p = 0.479, standard error of estimate (SEE) = 3.86; 1 month r = 0.468, p = 0.043, SEE = 4.70; 3 months r = 0.553, p = 0.014, SEE = 6.2; 6 months r = 0.611, p = 0.005, SEE = 5.88; 12 months r = 0.596, p = 0.007, SEE = 7.13. Regression analyses predicting change in % fat from change in BMI produced the following results: presurgery to 1 month r = -0.134, p = 0.583, SEE = 2.44%; 1-3 months r = 0.265, p = 0.272, SEE = 2.36%; 3-6 months r = 0.206, p = 0.398, SEE = 3.75%; 6-12 months r = 0.784, p = 0.000, SEE = 3.20. Although some analyses resulted in significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05), the relatively large SEE values would preclude the use of BMI in predicting % fat or change in % fat with weight loss in bariatric surgery patients."
"3";"We report a rare case of acute early postoperative small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass due to an intraluminal blood clot at the site of the jejuno-jejunostomy. Patient was treated successfully with enterotomy and removal of the clot. A review of literature showed three similar publications."
"3";"Lipoinjection is a promising treatment, but its efficacy in recontouring facial lipoatrophy remains to be established. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of lipoinjection and supplementation of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) to adipose grafts. To overcome drawbacks of autologous lipoinjection, we have developed a novel strategy called cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL). In CAL, stromal vascular fraction containing ASCs was freshly isolated from half of an aspirated fat sample and attached to the other half of aspirated fat sample with the fat acting as a scaffold. This process converts relatively ASC-poor aspirated fat into ASC-rich fat. We performed conventional lipoinjection (non-CAL; n=3) or CAL (n=3) on six patients with facial lipoatrophy due to lupus profundus or Parry-Romberg syndrome. All patients obtained improvement in facial contour, but the CAL group had a better clinical improvement score than did the non-CAL patients, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=.11). Adipose necrosis was found in one non-CAL case who took perioperative oral corticosteroids. Our results suggest that CAL is both effective and safe and potentially superior to conventional lipoinjection for facial recontouring. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters."
"3";"Laparoscopic gastric banding and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are widely used for the treatment of morbid obesity. The impact of these two procedures on health-related quality of life has not been analyzed in comparative studies. A matched-pair analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed. Fifty-two consecutive patients with laparoscopic gastric bypass were randomly matched to fifty-two patients with laparoscopic gastric banding according to age, BMI, and gender. Quality of life was assessed using two standardized questionnaires (SF 36 and Moorehead-Ardelt II). Mean preoperative BMI was 45.7 kg/m(2) for the bypass patients and 45.3 kg/m(2) for the banding patients. Mean BMI after 3 years follow-up of was 30.4 kg/m(2) and 33.1 kg/m(2) (p=0.036). In the SF 36 questionnaire, gastric bypass patients yielded a mean total score of 613 versus 607 points in the gastric banding group (p=0.543), which is comparable to the normal population in Europe. In the Moorhead-Ardelt II questionnaire, the gastric bypass patients scored a mean total of 1.35 points and the gastric banding patients 1.28 points (p=0.747). Of the patients, 97% with a gastric bypass and 83% with a gastric banding were satisfied with the result of the operation (p=0.145). The patients after laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic gastric banding have a high level of satisfaction 3 years after the operation and have similar quality of life scores compared to the normal population. Quality of life indexes were not different between the two procedures and were independent of weight loss in successfully operated patients."
"3";"To determine the long-term efficacy and safety of a low-pressure adjustable gastric band in the treatment for morbid obesity and to detect whether age, gender, or preoperative body mass index (BMI) has an impact on the outcome. It is well known that low-pressure adjustable gastric bands such as the Swedish adjustable gastric bands (SAGB) lead to weight loss. However, very few long-term studies have been published and questions remain regarding long-term efficacy and safety, and whether any of the patient's demographic parameters including age, gender, or initial BMI impact the long-term outcome. Six hundred consecutive patients who had a SAGB inserted between August 1996 and October 2005 were evaluated with regard to their initial BMI, age, and sex. There were 488 females and 112 males, with mean age 45.3 +/- 9.1, mean BMI 42.9 +/- 7.2 kg/m2, and mean weight 119.6 +/- 23.9 kg. Overall morbidity was 25.7% (10.4% perioperative, whereas 15.3% on long term). The following data represents 2, 3, 5, and 7 years of follow-up respectively. Mean BMI decreased to 30.9, 30.5, 32.7, and 31.2 kg/m2, whereas mean percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) was 60.5%, 61.5%, 53.2%, and 61.2%. Patients with BMI (<40 kg/m2) lost 63.7%, 61.2%, 45.5%, and 66.1% of their excess weight, whereas patients with BMI (40-49.9 kg/m2) lost 60.1%, 61.3%, 59.4%, and 66.6%, patients with BMI (50-50.9 kg/m2) lost 57.5%, 67.5%, 49.3%, and 40.2%, and patients with BMI (>60 kg/m2) lost 42.2%, 46.3%, 38.7%, and 40.2%. Female patients %EWL were 62.2%, 62.1%, 55.1%, and 62.3%, whereas male %EWL were 54.1%, 59.1%, 42.1%, and 51.3%. Patients <40 years %EWL were 61.8%, 62.5%, 57.1%, and 86.2%, whereas >40 years %EWL were 60.1%, 61.2%, 52.4%, and 60.1%. The SAGB is effective in achieving long-term sustainable weight loss with an acceptably low complication rate. Bands are effective regardless of patients' age and gender. Furthermore, preoperative BMI up to 60 kg/m2 does not influence the outcome."
"3";"The aim of this study was to define a standardized technique for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in the morbidly obese patient. There are several surgical options for the morbidy obese patient. In general, there are the restrictive procedures [e.g., laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)] and the malabsorptive procedures [e.g. laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP)]. Those techniques are already standardized. The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to have some advantages over both procedures, but it is not standardized yet, and so there can be no comparison between the different techniques. In our center we have standardized the LSG technique with respect to abdominal access and narrowness of the gastric sleeve. After dissection of the greater omentum and the short gastric vessels, the greater curvature is resected along a 34-Fr gastric tube using the Endo-GIA. The remaining gastric sleeve has a volume of about 100 ml. The standardized LSG procedure is presented step by step. A comparison of operative data and early outcome with a matched group of patients with adjustable gastric banding showed no difference between the two techniques with respect to operating time, surgical complications, and weight loss 6 months after surgery. With our standardized LSG technique it is possible to evaluate the positive aspects of the LSG compared with other standardized bariatric procedures like LAGB or LRYGBP."
"3";"We evaluated the efficacy of malabsorptive bariatric surgery on daily blood glucose fluctuations and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic obese patients. The 48-h continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring was assessed in type 2 diabetic patients before and 1 month after biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) (n = 36), or after diet-induced equivalent weight loss (n = 20). The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions and oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine) were evaluated during continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring. During a standardized meal, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, glucagon, and insulin were measured. Fasting and postprandial glucose decreased equally in surgical and diet groups. A marked increase in GLP-1 occurred during the interprandial period in surgical patients toward the diet group (P < 0.01). Glucagon was more suppressed during the interprandial period in surgical patients compared with the diet group (P < 0.01). Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions and nitrotyrosine levels decreased more after BPD than after diet (P < 0.01). Oxidative stress reduction after biliopancreatic diversion seems to be related to the regulation of glucose fluctuations resulting from intestinal bypass."
"3";"Duodenal localization of Crohn's disease is rare, accounting for only 0.5-4% of all cases. Most common complaints are gastric outlet obstruction and weight loss. Histologic findings of endoscopic biopsy are frequently not definitive, making differentiation from other, benign structures complicated. There are also no standard guidelines regarding indications for surgical management. We reviewed the cases of three surgically managed patients with duodenal Crohn's disease at the 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University of Medicine, Budapest, during a 5-year period (2002-2007). All three patients had persistent symptoms of stomach emptying disorder despite medical therapy and had severe weight loss (13-30 kg). In two cases resection of the stenotic duodenum was performed successfully using Billroth II method. Gastro-jejunal bypass was performed in one case, where the descendent duodenum was inflamed. All patients have been asymptomatic since surgery (9-45 months of follow-up) and recovered their earlier bodyweight. The postoperative period was uneventful. There is indication of surgery in cases of stenosing duodenal Crohn's disease, when medical therapy is not successful, but long-standing malnutrition should be treated preoperatively. We found perioperative morbidity to be similar in patients with duodenal Crohn's and in those with Crohn's disease of other intestinal locations."
"3";"Several studies have suggested that morbid obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). Studies have also suggested that there is an increase in vitamin D deficiency, bone resorption, and elevated PTH after gastric bypass surgery. Few studies have evaluated markers of bone and calcium metabolism after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding or compared these results to those after gastric bypass. Data on all patients undergoing primary gastric bypass (GBP; n = 979) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB; n = 269) procedures at a tertiary-referral center from June 1996 through March 2005 were reviewed from a prospective database. Only patients with 25OH vitamin D levels available were included in this study (n = 534; GBP = 403, LAGB = 131). All patients were advised to take at least 1,200 mg calcium and 800-1,200 IU of vitamin D daily before and subsequent to their operation. Markers for bone metabolism [25OH Vitamin D, corrected serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and PTH] were evaluated preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. An analysis of variance and chi-square were performed to determine differences between the operative groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between preoperative body mass index (BMI) and 25OH vitamin D and PTH levels and between percent excess weight loss and 25OH vitamin D and PTH after surgery. Sixty-four percent of all patients presented with vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) and 14% presented with elevated PTH preoperatively. Mean 25OH vitamin D levels and AP levels increased significantly after GBP surgery (vitamin D, 17 to 25 ng/ml 12 months post-op; AP, 80 to 90 IU/L 24 months post-op). Corrected calcium levels remained within normal limits and showed no change over time after both procedures. AP levels significantly increased from 76 IU/l preoperatively to 82 IU/l 6 months after LAGB surgery and then decreased to 59 IU/l 24 months after LAGB surgery. Linear regression analysis of preoperative vitamin D, PTH, and BMI values showed a significant positive relationship between initial BMI and PTH (r = 0.29) and a significant negative relationship between vitamin D and initial BMI (r = -0.19). A significant positive linear relationship between vitamin D and percent excess weight loss was evident 12 and 24 months after GBP surgery (r = 0.39 and 0.57, respectively). A negative relationship was evident between PTH and vitamin D 6 months after GBP surgery (r = -0.35) and 12 months after LAGB surgery (r = -0.61). These findings suggest that morbid obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency, and elevated PTH and with adequate supplementation, GBP, and particularly LAGB, patients can improve their bone metabolism abnormalities related to obesity. Furthermore, adequate supplementation for GBP patients may attenuate the increased risk for bone loss associated with malabsorption from the bypass."
"3";"Morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery are at risk for postoperative venous thromboembolism. Evidence-based recommendations regarding the dosing and duration of thromboprophylaxis are lacking for morbidly obese surgical patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an extended duration, body mass index (BMI)-stratified enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis regimen in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to determine the resultant antifactor Xa (AFXa) activity in morbidly obese surgical patients. In this prospective open trial, 223 patients (75% female, mean BMI 50.4 kg/m2) undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were assigned to receive enoxaparin 40 mg (BMI <or=50 kg/m2), n = 124) or 60 mg (BMI >50 kg/m2), n = 99) every 12 hours during hospitalization and once daily for 10 days after discharge. The AFXa levels were monitored serially, and dose adjustments were made for results outside the target prophylactic range (.2-.4 IU/mL +/- 10%) after the third dose. The safety and efficacy outcomes were major bleeding and venous thromboembolism. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed laparoscopically in 208 subjects (93%). The duration of surgery averaged 99.5 +/- 31 minutes, and the median length of hospitalization was 3 days. Target prophylactic AFXa concentration was achieved by 74% of patients after the third enoxaparin dose; none reached the full anticoagulation concentration. One patient developed nonfatal venous thromboembolism (.45%). Four patients required transfusion (1.79%). Bleeding was not associated with a high AFXa concentration. This BMI-stratified, extended enoxaparin dosing regimen provided well-tolerated, effective prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery."
"3";"Gynecomastia is a potential side effect of hormone therapy for prostate cancer. In large, randomized, placebo controlled studies approximately 50% or more of patients with prostate cancer experienced gynecomastia attributable to various mechanisms. Although it is mostly reported as mild to moderate, gynecomastia is one of the reasons most frequently cited for premature discontinuation of such treatment. Prophylactic radiotherapy and prophylactic tamoxifen have been shown to decrease the incidence of hormone-induced gynecomastia; nevertheless, there are still cases of refractory gynecomastia, and in these plastic surgery is needed for correction. Gynecomastia is a benign enlargement of the male breast, requiring no treatment unless it is a source of embarrassment and/or distress for the adolescent or man affected. The indications for surgical treatment of gynecomastia are founded on two main objectives: restoration of the male chest shape and diagnostic evaluation of suspected breast lesions. The authors believe that the complete circumareolar technique with no further scarring creates the best aesthetic results with fewer complications. When this is used in combination with liposuction very pleasing aesthetic results can be achieved."
"2";"Adiposity has been inversely associated with vitamin D concentration across a range of body mass index values and cultural groups. As obesity has increased markedly worldwide, a greater number of patients with severe obesity have been treated with gastric restrictive and/or malabsorptive surgical procedures. The purpose of this review was to describe current knowledge about vitamin D and severe obesity, and the impact of obesity surgery on vitamin D status. A systematic review was conducted with search terms obesity, vitamin D, osteoporosis, bone disease, gastric bypass, and obesity surgery in various combinations. Publications were limited to those since 2000 to control for similarity in vitamin D assays and obesity prevalence levels. Mean 25-hydroxy vitamin D was <80 nmol/l in more than 1,900 patients preoperatively, and was not restored to the optimal concentration of >80 nmol/l postoperatively. Both secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone loss were common, particularly when the obesity surgery included a malabsorptive component. Standard postsurgical supplementation with vitamin D and calcium have not been adequate to suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism or to restore 25-hydroxy vitamin D status. The mechanisms behind vitamin D deficiency in severe obesity and evidence-based corrective actions have not been well-defined. Of particular concern are adolescents who qualify for and elect surgical treatment of their obesity, where subsequent metabolic bone disease may be long-standing."
"3";"An underlying major aim of bariatric surgery is weight loss and its long-term maintenance. In spite of this, most studies regarding weight loss after surgical treatment of morbid obesity show 3-year follow-up results. We evaluated the effectiveness of silastic ring Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (SR-RYGBP) in promoting significant weight loss after an 8-year follow-up at the Londrina State University Hospital. From May 1999 to December 2000, 211 morbidly obese patients were submitted to SR-RYGBP by the same surgical team. The study's design was longitudinal, prospective, and descriptive. The analysis of postoperative weight decrease was based on excess weight loss in percentage (%EWL) and the calculation of body mass index. Therapeutic failure was considered when patients lost <50% of excess weight. Patients lost to follow-up were 36.5%; therefore, 134 patients were included in this study. The average global EWL was 67.6 ± 14.9% on the first postoperative year, 72.6 ± 14.9% on the second year, 69.7 ± 15.1% on the fifth postoperative year, and 66.8 ± 7.6% on the eight postoperative year. Surgical treatment failure occurred in 15 patients (7.1%) over 8 years. SR-RYGBP was effective in promoting and maintaining weight loss in the long term with a low failure rate."
"3";"Atelectasis occurs regularly after induction of general anesthesia, persists postoperatively, and may contribute to significant postoperative morbidity and additional health care costs. Laparoscopic surgery has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative atelectasis. It has been shown that during general anesthesia, obese patients have a greater risk of atelectasis than nonobese patients. Preventing atelectasis is important for all patients but is especially important when caring for obese patients. We randomly allocated 66 adult obese patients with a body mass index between 30 and 50 kg/m(2) scheduled to undergo laparoscopic bariatric surgery into 3 groups. According to the recruitment maneuver used, the zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) group (n = 22) received the vital capacity maneuver (VCM) maintained for 7-8 s applied immediately after intubation plus ZEEP; the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 group (n = 22) received the VCM maintained for 7-8 s applied immediately after intubation plus 5 cm H(2)O of PEEP; and the PEEP 10 group (n = 22) received the VCM maintained for 7-8 s applied immediately after intubation plus 10 cm H(2)O of PEEP. All other variables (e.g., anesthetic and surgical techniques) were the same for all patients. Heart rate, noninvasive mean arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and alveolar-arterial Pao(2) gradient (A-a Pao(2)) were measured intraoperatively and postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Length of stay in the PACU and the use of a nonrebreathing O(2) mask (100% Fio(2)) or reintubation were also recorded. A computed tomographic scan of the chest was performed preoperatively and postoperatively after discharge from the PACU to evaluate lung atelectasis. Patients in the PEEP 10 group had better oxygenation both intraoperatively and postoperatively in the PACU, lower atelectasis score on chest computed tomographic scan, and less postoperative pulmonary complications than the ZEEP and PEEP 5 groups. There was no evidence of barotrauma in any patient in the 3 study groups. Intraoperative alveolar recruitment with a VCM followed by PEEP 10 cm H(2)O is effective at preventing lung atelectasis and is associated with better oxygenation, shorter PACU stay, and fewer pulmonary complications in the postoperative period in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery."
"3";"The rapid growth of obesity rates has affected the practice of specialized nutrition support in various ways. One area that deserves special consideration is the impact that bariatric surgery, in particular complications resulting from bariatric surgery, has made on nutrition support practice. A descriptive survey was designed to evaluate this impact and to assess the various approaches to nutrition assessment and interventions in the postoperative bariatric surgery patient. A web-based survey consisting of 17 questions was administered in April 2006 to American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) members with available e-mail addresses. Participants were queried about professional background, primary practice setting, and various issues related to their involvement in the care of bariatric surgery patients. There were 467 responses returned out of 3400 surveys delivered (14% response rate). Sixty percent of responders estimated they were consulted to see 1-10 patients requiring specialized nutrition support over the previous year as a result of complications of bariatric surgery. The most common indications for specialized nutrition support in these patients were anastomotic leak/fistula (49%) and chronic nausea/vomiting (27%). When estimating calorie goals, 62% used an adjusted body weight, 15% used ideal body weight, and 14% used actual weight. When estimating protein goals, 56% used an adjusted body weight, 29% used ideal body weight, and 8% used actual weight. These observations provide impetus for guideline development and highlight the priority for further research regarding the best practices to ensure that postoperative bariatric surgery patients receive safe and appropriate nutrition support."
"3";"We reported a case of unresectable gastric cancer presenting pylorus stenosis treated orally by S-1 therapy in a 72-year-old man who underwent gastrojejunostomy. He was admitted to our hospital complaining of appetite loss and body weight loss. Detailed examination showed gastric cancer with pylorus stenosis. After insertion of the naso-gastric tube with washing, a laparotomy was done. The operative findings revealed sT3, sN2, sP1, sH0 and sM1 (metastases of No. 14a lymph nodes invading the super mesenteric artery and pancreas) as an unresectable case with stage IV. Gastrojejunostomy and Braun anastomosis were made through the antecolic route. After the operation, intake therapy of S-1 was started (80-100 mg/body/dayx28 days). After 2 courses of the therapy, gastrointestinal fiber showed clinically a partial response of the main tumor. After 3 courses of this treatment, the tumor presented multiple liver metastases as a clinically progressive disease state. Paclitaxel therapy was conducted at a dose of 80 mg/body/weekx3 timesx2 courses. The patient had no effective benefits from the treatment and died of the cancer. He had survived 9 months, and the intervals of the intake and home stay were 7.5 months and five months, respectively, after the operation with no side effect of the chemotherapy. Survival was no longer than for patients only operated without S-1 therapy."
"3";"Gynaecomastia can be classified on the basis of the main characterising factors, i.e. pathogenesis, histopathology and morphology. The morphological classifications of gynaecomastia currently made often use subjective parameters and qualifying adjectives. In this paper the authors propose a scheme for morphological classification of gynaecomastia which can serve as a guide for choosing the surgical technique, once the diagnosis of gynaecomastia as a benign pathology has been confirmed by preoperative examinations. A retrospective analysis was made of 121 cases of gynaecomastia operated on in the last 5 years. The extent of the clinical picture, the technique employed, the complications and the need to re-operate were observed and related. On the basis of this review the authors observed that when the nipple-areola complex is above the inframammary fold (grade I and grade II gynaecomastia), complete flattening of the thorax can be achieved by means of suction or ultrasound-assisted lipectomy and skin-sparing adenectomy. When the nipple-areola complex is at the same height as, or at most 1cm below the fold (grade III gynaecomastia), skin-sparing techniques are no longer sufficient to flatten the thorax, and it becomes necessary to remove the redundant skin by means of periareolar removal of epidermis. In cases of marked ptosis, when the nipple-areola complex is more than 1cm below the fold (grade IV gynaecomastia), reduction mastoplasty becomes necessary, with upper repositioning of the nipple-areola complex; in these cases central pedicle techniques make it possible to limit scarring in the periareolar areas. In the preoperative phase this simple classification may help in choosing the most suitable treatment, thus avoiding insufficient or invasive treatments and undesirable scars."
"3";"Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment option for obesity, and gut hormones are implicated in the reduction of appetite and weight after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Although there is increasing interest in the gut hormone changes after gastric bypass, the long-term changes have not been fully elucidated. Thirty-four participants were studied cross-sectionally at four different time points, pre-operatively (n = 17) and 12 (n = 6), 18 (n = 5) and 24 months (n = 6) after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Another group of patients (n = 6) were studied prospectively (18-24 months). All participants were given a standard 400 kcal meal after a 12-h fast, and plasma levels of peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were correlated with changes in appetite over 3 h using visual analogue scores. The post-operative groups at 12, 18 and 24 months had a higher post-prandial PYY response compared to pre-operative (p < 0.05). This finding was confirmed in the prospective study at 18 and 24 months. There was a trend for increasing GLP-1 response at 18 and 24 months, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.189) in the prospective study. Satiety was significantly reduced in the post-operative groups at 12, 18 and 24 months compared to pre-operative levels (p < 0.05). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass causes an enhanced gut hormone response and increased satiety following a meal. This response is sustained over a 24-month period and may partly explain why weight loss is maintained."
"3";"The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is an assessment frequently used in pre-surgical evaluation for patients seeking bariatric surgery. Items on the BDI reflect both cognitive and somatic symptoms associated with depression. However, many patients seeking bariatric surgery have medical symptomatology and health concerns independent of the syndrome of depression, and thus scores on the BDI may inflate their actual level of depression. With depression viewed by some clinicians as contraindicated for bariatric surgery, clarification of the BDI items is necessary. Pre-surgical BDIs of 259 bariatric patients were reviewed. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to examine the factor structure of the BDI in this population. Independent sample t-tests compared the means of the cognitive and somatic items. A clear two-factor solution emerged on the BDI, indicating items mapped on to either a cognitive or a somatic domain. The patients in the present sample also were more likely to endorse somatic and health-related symptoms on the BDI. The factor structure of the BDI in this population is similar to that in other non weight-loss surgery populations. However, this population is more likely to endorse somatic complaints that may not be indicative of depression, rather an acknowledgement of actual medical complaints. Thus, assessors should be mindful of specific symptom endorsement, rather than a total depression score when utilizing the BDI to help determine surgery suitability."
"3";"Nocturnal eating is common among obese patients prior to bariatric surgery. Little is known about the relationship between nocturnal eating, eating-related and general psychopathology, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). A group of 148 obese patients (mean BMI 49.3, SD 7.8) prior to bariatric surgery were investigated. We compared patients who reported nocturnal eating at least once in the last 4 weeks with patients without nocturnal eating episodes. Patients completed a battery of questionnaires assessing eating related and general psychopathology and quality of life. Twenty-nine (19.6%) patients reported nocturnal eating (eating after waking up at night) during the last 28 nights, men and women did not differ in frequency of nocturnal eating. Patients with nocturnal eating reported a significantly higher BMI (kg/m(2)), more feelings of hunger, and significantly more impairment in the mental aspects of HRQOL. The other measures of HRQOL showed only minor differences. Measures of general psychopathology (depression and anxiety) also differed significantly with nocturnal eating patients reporting significantly more impairment. Binge eating disorder and nocturnal eating showed no association."
"3";"Visfatin has shown to be increased in obesity and in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the change in plasma visfatin in severely obese (SO) persons after weight loss following bariatric surgery in relation to glucose concentration. Visfatin and leptin were studied in 53 SO persons (BMI, 54.4 +/- 6.8 kg/m(2)) before and 7 months after bariatric surgery and in 28 healthy persons (BMI, 26.8 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2)). All of the patients underwent bariatric surgery with biliopancreatic diversion or gastric bypass. The pre-surgery levels of visfatin in the SO group were greater than in the control group (55.9 +/- 39.9 vs. 42.9 +/- 16.6 ng/mL, p = 0.024). This increase was significant in the SO group with impaired fasting glucose (63.4 +/- 36.6 ng/mL) and diabetes (60.0 +/- 46.0 ng/mL). SO patients with normal fasting glucose had similar levels of visfatin to the controls. Seven months after surgery, visfatin levels were significantly increased (84.8 +/- 32.8 ng/mL, p < 0.001). This increase was independent of the pre-surgical glucose levels. The type of bariatric surgery had no influence on visfatin levels. Post-surgical visfatin was significantly correlated with the post-surgery plasma concentrations of leptin (r = 0.39, p = 0.014). Plasma levels of visfatin in the SO group were increased but only when accompanied by high glucose levels, even in the range of impaired fasting glucose. Bariatric surgery causes an increase in visfatin, which is correlated mainly with the changes produced in the leptin concentration."
"3";"Retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters may, over time, become incorporated into the wall of the IVC, making subsequent removal difficult. The authors present a case in which a Günther Tulip filter was placed prophylactically before gastric bypass surgery. The retrieval hook of the filter became incorporated into the wall of the IVC, preventing the filter from being snared. Eventually, the filter was freed from the wall of the IVC and successfully removed by using rigid bronchoscopy forceps; however, the filter was damaged in the process."
"3";"The aims of this study were to determine the rate of gastrojejunostomy (GJ) stricture following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), the independent predictors of stricture, and clinical outcomes with and without a stricture. Univariate and multivariate analysis of peri-operative and outcomes data were prospectively collected from 379 morbidly obese patients who underwent consecutive open or laparoscopic RYGBP from January 2003 to August 2006. Predictors studied were age, gender, BMI, co-morbidities, surgical technique (hand-sewn vs linear stapler vs 21-mm vs 25-mm circular stapler; open vs laparoscopic; retrocolic retrogastric vs antecolic antegastric Roux limb course, and Roux limb length), and surgeon experience. Outcomes studied consisted of occurrence of GJ strictures, technical details and outcomes after endoscopic therapy, and excess weight loss (EWL) at 12 months. 15 patients (4.1%) developed a GJ stricture. The use of a 21-mm circular stapler was identified as the only independent predictor of a GJ stricture (odds ratio 11.3; 95% CI 2.2-57.4, P = 0.004). Endoscopic dilation relieved stricture symptoms in all patients (60% one dilation only). There was no significant difference in %EWL at 12 months between the patients with a stricture (median EWL 54%, IQR 49-63) vs. those without a stricture (median EWL 61%, ent predictor of GJ stricture. Endoscopic dilation relieved symptoms in all patients. Weight loss is independent of the anastomotic technique used and occurrence of a GJ stricture."
"2";"The objective of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with severe obesity and late-stage type 2 diabetes (T2D). A review of the literature looked for reported data on outcomes of bariatric surgery when performed in patients with T2D treated by oral medications or insulin. Recent updates in our understanding of the effects of bariatric surgery on glucose homoeostasis were also examined. Data on the outcomes of bariatric surgery in advanced T2D are scarce. Having either T2D for more than 10 years or more advanced forms of the disease, according to antidiabetic therapy, is associated with less weight loss after bariatric surgery. Improvement of diabetes control is also less than seen in earlier forms of T2D, and resolution of the disease is less likely to occur. However, a reduction in oral medications or insulin doses has been documented. Residual beta-cell function is suggested to be a possible determining factor for therapeutic changes or cessation, while reductions in both weight-related and non-weight-related insulin resistance can be expected. Beneficial effects on co-morbidities and overall mortality due to the excess weight loss may also be seen. Bariatric surgery in patients with severe obesity and late-stage T2D is currently justified by the expected benefits due to the excess weight loss. However, specific studies are needed to better assess the effects of such surgery on glucose control and the associated outcomes."
"2";"Rhabdomyolysis (RML) and subsequent acute renal failure can be serious problems following bariatric operations. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to avoid the complications of RML. This review was achieved by searching the key words: Rhabdomyolysis, diagnosis, treatment and bariatric surgery. We included prospective, retrospective, case reports and review articles. RML diagnosis can be done by: signs and symptoms, physical evaluation, laboratory findings and imaging examinations. Muscle weakness, myalgia, decubitus ulcer, proteinuria and myoglobinuria are the more mentioned findings. Elevation of CPK levels is the most sensitive diagnostic evidence of RML. Treatment is geared toward preserving renal function by avoiding dehydration, hypovolemia, tubular obstruction, aciduria, and free radical release. Early recognition allows the administration of fluids, bicarbonate, and mannitol. Prophylactic measures and early diagnosis and treatment of rhabdomyolysis in bariatric surgery are imperative to prevent the potential fatal complications of this condition."
"1";"In the postoperative period hypoventilation and hypoxia with hypercarbia may occur in morbidly obese patients due to the residual influence of general anesthesia drugs, postoperative atelectasis and postoperative pain. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is a method of improvement of respiratory efficiency in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. The aim of the study was to compare NIV (Boussignac) CPAP and traditional oxygen delivery via nasal catheter in the postoperative acute care unit (PACU) in morbidly obese patients after open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). 19 morbidly obese patients scheduled for elective open RYGBP, were randomly divided into 2 groups: CPAP (10 patients) or control (nasal catheter - 9 patients). Patients consisted of: 8 male and 11 female, mean weight 127.76 +/- 18.5 kg, height 173.41 +/- 9.41 cm, BMI 42.43 +/- 3.3 kg/m2, age 35.84 +/- 9.05 years. In the PACU, capillary blood gas measurements were taken at 3 Time Points: T1 - 30 min, T2 - 4 hours and T3 - 8 hours after admission. Sample T0 was taken before surgery. For management of postoperative pain, patients received morphine 2 mg/h intravenously and tramadol 100 mg. Mean blood gas measurements of all postoperative time points were: pO2 81.0+/-16.0 (range 78.1-85.7) mmHg vs 65.9+/-4.9 (range 63.8-68.1) mmHg (P<0.05); pCO2 40.6+/-2.4 (range 39.4-41.8) mmHg vs 41.5+/-4.0 (range 39.6-43.4) mmHg (P>0.05), in the CPAP and control groups respectively. In every case, pulse-oxymetry oxygenation was >94%. Boussignac CPAP improved blood oxygenation compared to passive oxygenation with a nasal catheter but had no influence on CO2 elimination in non-CO2 retaining morbidly obese patients."
"2";"Lipin 1 plays critical roles in controlling energy metabolism. We sought to determine the expression of lipin 1 isoforms (lipin 1alpha and -beta) in liver and adipose tissue of obese subjects and to evaluate cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of lipin 1 expression by physiologic stimuli. The expression of lipin 1alpha and -beta was quantified in liver and adipose tissue of extremely obese (average BMI 60.8 kg/m(2)) human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GBS). Second, the expression of lipin 1 was evaluated in HepG2 cells in response to overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha under normal or hyperinsulinemic conditions. The expression of lipin 1beta in liver and adipose tissue was inversely related to BMI, fasting plasma insulin concentration, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance but was significantly increased by marked weight loss and insulin sensitization following GBS. Hepatic lipin 1beta mRNA levels were strongly correlated with the expression of PGC-1alpha, and overexpression of PGC-1alpha in HepG2 cells increased lipin 1 expression. Conversely, hyperinsulinemic culture conditions downregulated the expression of lipin 1beta, PGC-1alpha, and their known target genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism in HepG2 cells. Finally, overexpression of lipin 1beta or PGC-1alpha reversed the effect of hyperinsulinemia on the expression of their target genes. These studies suggest that hepatic lipin 1beta and PGC-1alpha expression are downregulated by obesity and obesity-related metabolic perturbations in human subjects, likely due to alterations in insulin concentration or sensitivity."
"3";"After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), the excluded gastric remnant represents a challenge for the surgeon. Many diseases are reported to take place in that remnant, such as cancer, gastritis, and ulcer. On the other hand, diagnosing these pathological changes requires invasive intervention. We report the use of a noninvasive study to diagnose pathology in the bypassed stomach."
"1";"Banded gastric bypass has been reported to result in superior weight loss compared with standard nonbanded gastric bypass. However, an adequate comparison of these procedures has not yet been reported. A total of 90 patients were enrolled in this prospective randomized double-blind trial comparing banded and nonbanded open gastric bypass for the treatment of super obesity. The banding technique involved placement of a 1.5 x 5.5-cm polypropylene band around the proximal gastric pouch of a standard gastric bypass procedure using the technique of Capella. Chi-square testing and analysis of variance were performed to find any differences in patient characteristics (gender, age, and initial body mass index), percentage of excess weight lost at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively, improvement or resolution of co-morbidities, and complications in the banded versus nonbanded gastric bypass groups. As expected, no differences were present in the patient characteristics or incidence of co-morbidities between the banded (n = 46) and nonbanded (n = 44) groups. The body mass index, percentage of women, and mean age was 59.5 and 56.5 kg/m2, 64% and 73.8% (P = .09), and 40.6 +/- 7.4 and 42.6 +/- 7.2 years for the banded and nonbanded groups, respectively; all differences were nonsignificant. No significant differences were found in the resolution of co-morbidities. No significant difference was present in the percentage of excess weight loss at 6, 12, and 24 months (43.1% versus 24.7%, 64.0% versus 57.4%, and 64.2% versus 57.2%, respectively) postoperatively; however, the banded patients had achieved a significantly greater percentage of excess weight loss at 36 months (73.4% versus 57.7%; P <.05). The incidence of intolerance to meat and bread was greater in the banded patients. The overall number of complications was 12 (26%) in the banded and 13 (29.5%) in the nonbanded group, a nonsignficant difference. No band erosions had occurred at the last follow-up visit, and no patients in either group died. These results suggest that although the initial weight loss was not significantly different between the 2 groups, the banded patients continued to lose weight for < or = 3 years. The polypropylene band appeared to be well tolerated. We plan longer follow-up to confirm the possibility of additional weight loss and the prevention of weight regain in the banded group, as well as to document any long-term band complications."
"3";"Surgery in patients with super-obesity (BMI > or = 50) involves technical difficulties that are related, among other factors, to increased liver volume. Although the intragastric balloon is not a definitive alternative to surgery, it has been used in these patients as a primary therapeutic means of reducing excess weight and the risks of subsequent surgery. It has also been reported to considerably diminish liver volume to facilitate technical aspects of the operation. We evaluated preoperative weight loss in patients with super-obesity after placement of an intragastric balloon and its effect on liver volume measured by computed axial tomography (CT) prior to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). The balloon was implanted preoperatively under endoscopic guidance and sedation in 31 patients with super-obesity, to reduce weight prior to LRYGBP. Two patients were excluded from the study for intolerance and the balloon was removed 2 weeks after placement. Measurement of liver volume was done with axial images obtained by spiral CT with a section thickness of 10 mm, reconstitution index 10 mm, pitch 1.5 and acquisition delay 60 seconds. Volumes were calculated using the sum of areas technique. Measurement of volume was done in these 29 patients prior to balloon placement and the week before surgery. After placement of the balloon, 27 patients (93%) had nausea and 25 patients (86%) had vomiting, which abated 1 week after placement. Mean liver volume prior to balloon placement was 2938.53 +/- 853.1 cm3, which at 6 weeks dropped to values of 1918.2 +/- 499.8 cm3, revealing a considerable reduction in liver volume [31.8% +/- 18.16% (range 3.1%-58.5%)]. Percent of excess weight loss was 22.14% +/- 7.39. LRYGBP was performed at 6 months. In patients with super-obesity, preoperative treatment with intragastric balloon considerably reduces liver volume to facilitate LRYGBP."
"3";"The antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix) is widely used in patients who have undergone coronary artery stenting or had a stroke. Because morbid obesity is associated with atherosclerosis, some of these patients are candidates for weight loss surgery. We chose to determine the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass in patients taking clopidogrel. Patients who took clopidogrel after gastric bypass were identified by specific review of the subset of patients who had had upper gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospital admission and transfusion. All who bled underwent emergency endoscopy. Of 11 patients taking clopidogrel, 4 (36%) presented with significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding 25-234 days after gastric bypass. All stopped bleeding with discontinuation of the drug and treatment with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor. Gastric bypass patients appear to be at high risk of bleeding complications when taking clopidogrel. On the basis of the available published data from another high-risk group (i.e., those with a history of peptic ulcer disease), co-treatment with omeprazole may be indicated when clopidogrel must be continued."
"3";"Arm lymphedema is a common complication after breast cancer treatment. Various types of conservative and surgical treatments have aimed at reducing the arm swelling, but most of these have failed due to chronic edema eventually being transformed from an accumulation of lymph fluid to an increased deposition of subcutaneous fat (i.e., to a nonpitting lymphedema). Liposuction is a safe and reliable method for reducing the excess fat without recurring deposition of it. The objective of the present study was to obtain empirical evidence confirming clinical observations of the presence of excess adipose tissue in patients with chronic nonpitting arm lymphedema following breast cancer. A total of 11 women with nonpitting unilateral postmastectomy arm lymphedema were investigated and were treated as follows: The patient's excess arm volume was measured by plethysmography (PG) and, following treatment by liposuction, was observed until complete reduction of the excess volume was achieved. Volume-rendered CT images (VR-CT) and PG were used to analyze arm volumes and excess volume of the lympedematous arm, the respective volumes being compared by use of regression analysis. Liposuction aspirate was analyzed in terms of the distribution of adipose tissue and free fluid (lymph). The aspirate volume (total and fat fraction) was compared both with the excess arm volume measured by VR-CT and PG, and with the excess fat volume measured by VR-CT. The amount of excess adipose tissue in the lymphedematous arm was estimated using VR-CT. A complete reduction of the excess arm volumes, as measured with PG, was achieved within 6 months, with a mean reduction of 109%, the treated arm thus becoming somewhat smaller than the normal one. Correlations in terms of correlation coefficient (CC) and the coefficient of regression (CR) were all close to 1: The preoperative PG and the VR-CT analyses of (a) the swollen arms of the patients and (b) the excess volume; the total aspirated volume, and the excess volume of the arm, the aspirate fat volume, and the excess fat volume. The aspirate removed under bloodless conditions, achieved by use of a tourniquet, contained 93% adipose tissue. VR-CT was able to estimate the amount of excess adipose tissue in the lymphedematous arm, showing a mean excess amount of fat of 81%. VR-CT measurements correlate well with PG measurements. Excess adipose tissue dominates nonpitting chronic arm lymphedema. This excess volume cannot be removed by use either of conservative regimens or of microsurgery. Liposuction can completely remove the excess adipose tissue, leading to complete reduction of the lymphedema."
"2";"To characterize the clinical features, risk factors, radiographic findings, and prognosis of Wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, Ovid, ISI (Science Citation Index), and Google Scholar for case reports, case series, or cohort studies of Wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery. We found 32 cases (27 of whom were women) reported, from 2 weeks to 18 months after the procedure. Most patients had vomiting as a risk factor (n = 25) and presented with the triad of Wernicke encephalopathy (confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus; n = 21). Optic neuropathy, papilledema, deafness, seizures, asterixis, weakness, and sensory and motor neuropathy were also reported. Characteristic radiographic findings were hyperintense signals in the periaqueductal gray area and dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus; radiographs were normal in 15 patients. One series from Brazil reported 4 patients (among 50 patients) with Wernicke encephalopathy; all presented with vomiting and concomitant peripheral neuropathy at a median of 2.5 months (1.5 to 3 months) after bariatric surgery. Another series identified 2 of 23 patients (both women) with Wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery. Wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery usually occurs between 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively, especially in young women with vomiting. Atypical neurologic features are common. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, because radiographic findings are normal in some patients. Prospective studies to determine the prevalence of this problem and protocols for preventive thiamine supplementation need evaluation."
"3";"Body contouring surgery is traditionally part of plastic surgery training. Reconstructive techniques are needed most in trauma cases, tumor reconstructions, treatment of degenerative diseases and metabolic diseases such as Madelung's deformity, body contouring after massive weight loss, and all aesthetic plastic surgery. With various surgical techniques, liposuction became an important option in the overall treatment plan. Body contouring surgery in the massive weight loss patient is a rapidly expanding field of plastic surgery. Its challenge is the management of excess skin remaining after bariatric surgery. To achieve an aesthetic body contour, patients must accept numerous long scars. They must understand that recurrent laxity and scar migration is not necessarily a failure of the operation but rather an expected outcome. Body contouring surgery is challenging, time-consuming, and not without complications. The patient population has very real aesthetic and appearance concerns that must be addressed in an effective, definite, and safe manner."
"3";"As bariatric surgery becomes more popular, the number of renal transplant recipients who undergo weight loss surgery will continue to grow. This population presents unique challenges because of increased infection risks, tendency to posttransplant weight gain, and inferior tissue-healing properties. We present two cases of renal transplant recipients who experienced the complications of band erosion and band migration after laparoscopic gastric banding, and we discuss the special considerations that apply to this patient population."
"3";"Massive weight loss following bariatric surgery may lead to an excess of lax, overstretched skin, causing physical discomfort which may affect the patient's quality of life. Whereas the functional and aesthetic deformity is an expected result of massive weight loss, the role of the plastic surgeon in the multidisciplinary approach of the morbidly obese is still unclear. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the results of reconstructive surgery following weight loss surgery, focusing on the impact on the physical and psycho-social well-being and quality of life of the patients. Out of a group of 465 patients, 61 patients underwent reconstructive surgery following weight loss surgery. In 43 respondents, the quality of life after reconstructive surgery was measured by the Obesity Psychological State Questionnaire. Patient satisfaction was evaluated. Reconstructive surgery resulted in a significant improvement in quality of life in patients at a mean interval of 42 months between weight loss and reconstructive surgery. The most frequent procedures were abdominoplasty and breast reconstruction. The relative high complication rate of 27.9% was of no influence on quality of life and the majority of the patients (67%) were satisfied with reconstructive surgery. This study shows that reconstructive surgery following weight loss after bariatric surgery results in a significant improvement in overall quality of life. Reconstructive surgery should be incorporated in the multidisciplinary care programme following weight loss surgery in the morbidly obese patient."
"3";"We report the rare case of a pregnant woman who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 8 months previously, and now presented with subacute small bowel obstruction secondary to internal herniation of some of the proximal Roux limb into the lesser sac through the transverse mesocolon rent, which was widely spread apart. At laparoscopy, the hernia contents were reduced and the defect was repaired. The patient made a good recovery. Because of the changes associated with pregnancy, gastric bypass patients may be at an increased risk of internal herniation. It is particularly important not to delay surgical exploration, even in the absence of a positive finding on imaging, because delay may lead to potentially devastating bowel strangulation and sepsis culminating in loss of fetus and mother."
"2";"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains as the first cause of death worldwide. Scientific community works everyday trying to ameliorate this burden. Only in the year 2004 around 2,790 publications about the therapeutic use of antihypertensive agents can be found in MEDLINE. Despite this overwhelming effort and information, only a relatively short number of manuscripts have a real impact in clinical practice. For the busy clinician, it becomes almost impossible to screen and be updated with the landmark publications. The purpose of this article is to provide concise information related to prevention of CVD. We reviewed publications in the past 5 years regarding cardiovascular risk factors with special attention to dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking cessation and obesity, discussing some new findings and treatments. We also discuss obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a recently identified cardiovascular risk factor, and provide a general overview about its pathophysiology and treatment."
"3";"A decreased length of stay (LOS) is one of the many advantages of laparoscopic over open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, the mean LOS after laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB) ranges from 1.8 to 4.5 days. In addition, the LOS has tended to improve as bariatric programs have matured. With the use of a standardized perioperative care plan, we studied the effects of LOS on readmission rates in patients undergoing LGB in a new minimally invasive bariatric surgery program. All patients undergoing LGB between September 20, 2001 and April 5, 2004 were entered into a standardized perioperative care plan. All patient outcomes were entered into a prospective database. The discharge criteria included adequate oral intake and adequate pain control on oral medication. The reasons for patients staying >2 days were analyzed and documented. A total 250 patients underwent LGB. Of these, 212 patients (84.8%) were discharged on postoperative day 2. The most common reason for a LOS >2 days was bleeding (42.1%), followed by nausea (26.3%), inadequate pain control on oral medication (15.8%), and various other reasons (15.8%). The mean LOS did not change with time (P = .19). Readmission within 30 days was significantly less in patients discharged by day 2 (1.9% versus 13.1%, P = .005). The LOS remained constant as our program matured. The vast majority of patients undergoing LGB who have an uncomplicated postoperative course were safely discharged home on postoperative day 2. Patients staying >2 days were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge."
"3";"Despite the ever-growing body of literature linking stage of physical activity readiness (PAR) with physical activity (PA) participation in overweight and obese populations, this relationship has not been examined among individuals seeking gastric bypass surgery (GBS). Furthermore, little is known about the specific intensity of activities undertaken by GBS candidates. Therefore, this study sought to determine whether greater PAR was associated with greater moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) participation among GBS candidates. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), administered 2-weeks presurgery to 87 GBS candidates, determined MVPA participation using a formula based on metabolic equivalents (MET)-minutes/week. A stages-of-change measure categorized each candidate into one of five PAR stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or maintenance. The proportion of individuals in each PAR stage and the corresponding MVPA was as follows: contemplation (5.7%, 48.0 MET-minutes/week), preparation (46%, 394.0 MET-minutes/week), action (34.5%, 1614.0 MET-minutes/week), and maintenance (13.8%, 2056.7 MET-minutes/week). MVPA was significantly greater in candidates in the action or maintenance stages compared with those in contemplation (P =.008 and .025 for action and maintenance, respectively) or preparation (P < .0001 and .006 for action and maintenance, respectively). This study is the first to demonstrate a relationship between PAR and PA among GBS candidates, with 100% of the sample reporting either an intention to engage in PA or actual engagement in PA. This finding, coupled with the recent support for the importance of PA for weight loss/maintenance in GBS patients, warrants an investigation into the effectiveness of presurgical and postsurgical PA interventions matched to patients' PAR levels."
"3";"Although reports on band erosion management after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) agree that in most cases the affected band will need to be removed, there is no consensus on the technique of removal. We report a minimalistic, laparoscopic technique which is safe and avoids management delay. We retrospectively reviewed the operative log of our obesity surgery unit to find all operations performed on LAGB patients for erosion from Jan 2003 to Dec 2007. The cases that underwent this particular technique were identified. Case notes and electronic records were then reviewed for postoperative morbidity and outcomes. The operative technique and indications of this particular method is described which to our knowledge has not been reported before. From 2003 to 2007, there were 865 LAGB performed. We identified 17 operations performed for erosions in this period; some referred from elsewhere. Among these, an omental plugging technique was used in five patients (median preoperative body mass index 46.5; median age 47; all female). Median timing of presentation was 8 months, with pain/pyrexia in all five (with coexisting obstructive symptoms in four) patients. At endoscopy, three were posterior, partial erosions. Intraoperatively, all were partial erosions (three posterior and two anterior). In theater, we removed the band in all cases and closed the defect with a vascularized omental plug, fashioned using a harmonic scalpel. There were no immediate postoperative complications. On follow-up, two patients stayed the same weight, but in three, the weight increased leading to two needing rebands (at 6 and 8 months). Omental plugging is a way of managing LAGB erosion, which in our hands has led to an uneventful postoperative course and future rebanding without undue delay. It is suited patients with incomplete erosion when the endoscopic option is difficult, thereby removing the need for a surveillance period awaiting complete band erosion."
"3";"This study examined two related and confused body image constructs--overevaluation and body image dissatisfaction--and tested their distinctiveness by examining their longitudinal associations with changes in self-esteem and negative affect. One hundred forty-five obese (mean BMI = 51.6, SD = 7.5) patients (16 men and 129 women) completed a battery of self-report measures prior to and six months after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Measures of body image (overevaluation of shape and weight, and body image dissatisfaction), self-esteem, and negative affect were assessed. Overevaluation and body image dissatisfaction both improved substantially following surgery. Change in overevaluation was significantly correlated only with change in self-esteem (after controlling for negative affect). Whereas change in body image dissatisfaction was significantly correlated with changes in both self-esteem and negative affect; findings for partial correlations remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that evaluating oneself by shape and weight is related to, but not the same as, being dissatisfied about shape and weight. Given that overevaluation is less likely to be influenced by mood, it appears to be a more stable marker for disturbance in body image than body image dissatisfaction. This distinction has important implications for how clinicians and researchers assess these constructs."
"3";"One goal of lipoplasty is to create a round and projected buttock contour. Despite multiple papers evaluating lipoinjection, controversies still remain. This report describes a series of patients who underwent liposuction, gluteal lipoinjection, and evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). From January 2003 to January 2004, the patients scheduled for contour surgery by the investigators were evaluated using MRI, photographic records, and gluteal circumference measurement 1 week before surgery, then 2 weeks and 3 months after the procedure. A statistical analysis was performed for 10 patients who received, on the average, a 350-ml injection of fat obtained during liposuction. Gluteus muscle volume increased, reaching a higher level 2 weeks after the injection than the level 3 months afterward (p < 0.001). The gluteal circumference, modified 2 weeks after surgery by about 1 to 3 cm, came back to previous values 3 months after the procedure (p < 0.05), a phenomena interpreted as reabsorption and resolution of the postoperative edema. There is no correlation between the gluteus muscle volume obtained by MRI and the gluteal circumference (p > 0.05). The findings led to the conclusion that enhancement of the gluteal contour after fat injection results from survival of the injected tissue 3 months after the surgery, which was objectively evaluated by MRI as having a calculated reabsorption rate of 24% to 36%."
"3";"A 61-year-old woman presented 29 years after loop gastric bypass with a cancer of the gastric pouch. The cancer was removed by en bloc resection of the pouch, residual stomach and involved transverse colon with Roux-en-Y esophago-jejunal reconstruction. Very few cases of gastric cancer have been reported following gastric bypass for obesity. This case represents the first reported gastric cancer arising in the gastric pouch following loop gastric bypass."
"3";"The increased prevalence of morbid obesity is associated with an increased prevalence of obesity co-morbidities. Bariatric surgery is generally the only effective treatment. Gastric bypasses are the most common bariatric operation in many countries, and more than half are performed laparoscopically. We discuss the challenges encountered in performing laparoscopic gastric bypass and cholecystectomy in a morbidly obese patient who was found to have malrotated small and large bowel when the procedure started. In the absence of past gastrointestinal symptoms and investigations, there is no way of diagnosing this anomaly preoperatively. However, when such a problem is posed at the time of surgery, it is safe to perform the planned operation if the surgeon has experience and skills in advanced laparoscopic techniques."
"3";"The authors had summarized more than 25-year experience of surgical treatment of patients with the lower and upper extremities lymphedema. The aspiration-resectional-plastic method of treatment of severe forms of the limb lymphedema, which intends in the first stage the resection of fibrously changed tissues, preserving the portion of slightly changed cutaneous-subcutaneous flaps and regions in projection of localization of main lymphatic collectors, under which aspiration lipectomy is performed. Postresectional wound surface is covered with special synthetic tissue. In the next stage, after appearance of granulation tissue, autodermoplasty is performed. Two-staged cutaneous plasty and repeated aspirational lipectomy provides for optimal survival of full thickness cutaneous transplants, reduction of the limb volume, improvement of the lymphatic system draining function."
"1";"The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of a self-adherent soft silicone dressing (Mepiform) with 'left-alone' management of hypertrophic scars using theVancouver Scar Scale. Secondary objectives were to follow photographs of the scars, patients' opinions of the scars, and doctors' and patients' assessments of the overall dressing performance, safety and tolerance. An exploratory open randomised controlled clinical investigation was undertaken on 11 female patients aged 21-43 years with postoperative scars (nine following breast surgery, two following lower abdominal-glutealplasty). Treatment was initiated between two weeks and two months (mean 4.7 weeks) after surgery. Ten patients completed the 12-month investigation; one patient in the treatment group discontinued for personal reasons. All parameters in the Vancouver Scar Scale improved in both groups, although patients treated with the soft silicone dressing showed greater and more rapid improvements compared with the non-treated patients, while their assessments of the condition of the scar were more favourable. Medical staff rated the overall dressing performance as 'very good' or'good'. One adverse event was reported--local skin irritation at the site of the scar. The results suggest that patients treated with the soft silicone dressing experienced greater and more rapid improvements compared with non-treated patients. These results concur with those of previous studies. The fact that Mepiform is self-adhesive and causes limited damage to the stratum corneum on removal gives it an added value compared with non-adhesive silicone gel dressings."
"3";"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of incidental elevation of liver enzymes in North America and Europe. Risk factors for NAFLD include body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater, central obesity and diabetes mellitus. The spectrum of disease is variable, ranging from simple steatosis with benign prognosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, conferring increase in morbidity and mortality. The primary abnormality or 'first hit' in patients with NAFLD is insulin resistance leading to hepatic steatosis. The second hit involves multiple proinflammatory cytokines resulting in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Treatment is aimed at aggressive risk factor control and weight loss. Currently, there are no pharmacological agents recommended in the treatment of NAFLD, although preliminary studies suggest promising agents in the future."
"3";"Obesity is associated with many comorbid pathologies that lead to increased morbidity and increased mortality. Hemorheological changes in obesity are currently investigated as one of the risk factors for many comorbid pathologies. It has been found that erythrocyte hyperaggregation and a decrease in erythrocyte filterability have also been well documented in obesity patients. The aim of this study is to present preliminary results of the influence of weight reduction after vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) on aggregation of red cells and red blood cells deformability. We studied seven patients who underwent VBG, median age 46 years (range 35-52), median BMI 52.1 kg/m(2) (range 36.6-66). Blood rheology changes and selected biochemical parameters were examinated before and 6 months after VBG. Erythrocyte elongation and red blood cells (RBC) aggregation were measured using the Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyser (LORCA). The RBC aggregation index was significantly decreased, while the aggregation half-time (t(1/2)) significantly elongated after surgery. The syllectogram amplitude did not change. No differences in RBC deformability were observed in the postoperative period. Conclusion: We could conclude that among morbidly obese patients six months after VBG some beneficial changes of erythrocyte rheological parameters are observed. Further studies are necessary to confirm our preliminary results."
"3";"The outcome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) in morbidly obese (MO) (body mass index [BMI] 40-50) was compared with super-obese (SO) (BMI >50) and super-super-obese (SSO) (BMI >60) patients. A prospective study was conducted in 738 consecutive patients who underwent RYGBP. 483 MO were compared with 184 SO and 70 SSO. Study endpoints included: effect on co-morbid conditions, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and long-term results. Statistical analysis utilized SPSS 11.0. Percentage of males was significantly greater in the SO groups (16.5% vs 13%, P=0.01). Obesity-related conditions were significantly more frequent in the SO groups: sleep apnea (38% vs 17%, P<0.0005), gallstones (23% vs 14%, P=0.013); diabetes (29% vs 17%, P=0.002). Hospital stay was longer in the SO groups (5.7+/-6.1 days vs 4.6+/-2.6 days, P=0.024). Wound infection was more frequent in the SO groups (4.7% vs 1.4%, P=0.019). Postoperative mortality was greater in the SSO and SO groups (1.6% and 1.4%) than MO (0%) (P=0.019). Incisional hernia was more frequent in the SO groups (14.1% vs 8.6%; P=0.041). There was no significant difference in percent of excess weight loss (%EWL) between the three groups. EWL >50% at 5 years was: MO 81.5%, SO 87.5%, SSO 80%. The surgery was effective in treating the co-morbid conditions. RYGBP achieved significant durable weight loss and effectively treated co-morbid conditions in SO and SSO patients with acceptable postoperative morbidity and slightly greater mortality than in MO patients."
"3";"Obesity is a major public health problem in developed nations worldwide. Currently, the only treatment for severe obesity (BMI > or = 35 kg/m2 with comorbidity) that provides long-term weight loss is bariatric surgery. Restrictive, malabsorptive, and combination procedures have been developed. Each type of procedure has its merits and unique set of risks and complications. Weight loss after bariatric surgery is accompanied by predictable improvement or resolution of obesity-related comorbidities and improved quality of life and life expectancy. Candidates for bariatric surgery are often at high risk for complications because of obesity-related comorbidities. Therefore, careful patient selection for bariatric surgery, together with well-designed strategies for preventing and managing complications, are keys to success. Close monitoring for nutritional deficiencies and short- and long-term complications is required to completely assess outcomes of these procedures."
"3";"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) has been demonstrated to be comparable to open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (ORYGBP) surgery in randomized studies. Although a steep learning curve exists, laparoscopic bariatric surgery offers advantages if performed by an experienced bariatric surgeon. Despite these facts, some patients still choose to undergo ORYGBP. This investigation explored the reasons why patients who have had LRYGBP would decide to undergo the laparoscopic operation. A survey was given to patients who had undergone LRYGBP. The survey was designed to ascertain what factors would influence them to have LRYGBP versus ORYGBP. Incomplete responses were not included in the data analysis. There were 41 patients who filled out the survey. Over 90% of the patients felt LRYGBP is better than open gastric bypass. There were 4 patients who had seen another surgeon who recommended ORYGBP. Approximately 61% (23/38) of the patients would have stayed with their surgeon even if their surgeon did not offer LRYGBP. In addition, 79% of patients (31/39) would have ORYGBP if their insurance did not cover LRYGBP. Most patients (67%) would have ORYGBP if their surgeon thought LRYGBP was experimental. If they were told that LRYGBP was too risky for them, 77% of patients (30/39) would have undergone ORYGBP. Only 15% of patients (6/40) would not have had surgery if LRYGBP did not exist. Patients are willing to undergo ORYGBP even if they believe that LRYGBP is better. Non-medical factors and/or surgeon recommendations instead of scientific data influence patient decision-making when choosing ORYGBP over LRYGBP."
"2";"The management of nonalcoholic fatty liver has been limited by a paucity of well-conducted studies that are of sufficient duration and quality to determine the outcome, which is best defined by liver biopsy. The mainstays, diet and physical activity plus behavioral modifications, are not always successful, particularly in the very obese. Although it is intuitive to expect that weight loss should diminish steatosis, only limited evidence exists that liver enzymes improve with reduction in body weight. The available pharmacologic therapy has focused on the two limbs of the pathogenetic basis for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), insulin resistance and oxidative stress, but with quite limited success. Neither behavioral, nor dietary, nor drug therapy has been particularly effective either in obesity or NASH. In the severely obese, the fatty liver and its stages often have progressed to NASH or cirrhosis even before contemplating therapy. In the severely obese, the best therapeutic modality is bariatric surgery, which is safe and has been successful in producing a 61% weight loss overall. The result is improvement in diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, and presumably its sequelae. Early reports (and procedures) were attended with dramatic weight loss but markedly aggravated the inflammatory liver disease. In recent trials with more modest weight loss and less malnutrition, bariatric surgery reduced the fat, inflammation, and even the fibrosis in well-documented NASH. These promising procedures will undoubtedly increase and constitute the major therapeutic modality for those who are severely obese."
"3";"The current study sought to find indications for the appropriateness of a model in which eating patterns and exercise beliefs influence binge eating and physical exercise, respectively, that, in turn, influence outcome after gastric banding for severe obesity. Participants were 157 patients (144 females, 13 males) who completed questionnaires approximately 34 months (range = 8-68 months) after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Our data showed a well-fitting model in which external and emotional eating were associated with outcome through binge eating. Several exercise beliefs were associated with physical exercise, but physical exercise was not associated with weight loss or physical health. Binge eating was related more strongly to the outcome after gastric banding than physical exercise. Future research should examine whether a strong focus on the management of binge eating and external and emotional eating could improve the outcome of morbidly obese patients with unsuccessful weight outcome after obesity surgery."
"3";"Wernicke's encephalopathy was originally described more than a decade ago. It has been reported after many causes of malnutrition. This case presents a patient with thiamine deficiency after gastric bypass, although unusual in itself, further complicating the case was the initial diagnosis of acute psychosis that was scheduled for electroconvulsive therapy. After recognition and intervention, the patient was successfully treated with thiamine replacement and parenteral nutrition."
"3";"Open surgery is still used to treat massive combined paraesophageal and hiatal hernias. The operative principles include repositioning of the stomach in the abdomen, resection of the hernia sac, narrowing of the hiatus, and gastropexy. We report on a case in which a life-threatening, gastro-pericardial fistula was an early complication after open surgical treatment."
"3";"In the general population, African-American females are more obese and resistant to weight loss than Caucasian women. In the present study, we examined the severity of obesity among morbidly obese African-American and Caucasian females, studied the effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), and sought to identify factors contributing to obesity and weight loss. The study population included 153 morbidly obese females randomly selected from our general bariatric patient population. Anthropometric measurements consisted of body weight, body mass index (BMI), excess weight, and waist, hip, thigh, and neck circumferences. Factors that may contribute to obesity included age, age of obesity onset, number of childbirths, calorie intake, diet composition, and degree of psychological distress. The effects of RYBGP were studied in weight-matched groups of African-American and Caucasian females (n=37 per group) at weight loss nadir, i.e. 12 to 18 months after surgery. We found that morbid obesity is more severe among African-American than Caucasian females. The greater degree of obesity of African-American, as compared to Caucasian, females is not due to ethnic differences in calorie intake, diet composition, age or age of obesity onset, number of childbirths, and psychological distress. RYGBP is less effective in reducing body fat and, consequently, excess body weight of the African-American than the Caucasian females, suggesting possible ethnic differences in fat metabolism. African-American females with morbid obesity have greater adiposity than do Caucasian women and lose significantly less body fat after RYGBP."
"3";"Visceral surgery has benefited from several significant therapeutical improvements in 2005. They involve more specifically endocrine surgery, obesity, ovarian cancer, rectocele and cystic pancreatic neoplasia. Minimal invasive surgery is increasingly used, for example in endocrine conditions and obesity treatment. New techniques also emerge, such as electrical gastric stimulation for obesity or Stapled Trans Anal Rectal Resection (STARR) for anterior rectocele. Accurate diagnosis criteria allow better management of cystic pancreatic neoplasia, especially to choose the best treatment of this condition."
"3";"This article discusses intravenous sedation, the authors' anesthesia of choice when performing most esthetic body contour refinement procedures. This technique is comfortable, safe, contemporary, and beneficial to the patient and medical crew. The preanesthesia evaluation is emphasized as a safety and high-quality action to any anesthesia procedure. Alternative anesthesia techniques are also discussed, including their possible advantages, disadvantages, indications, and counterindications."
"2";"The primal need for nutrients is satisfied by mechanisms for sensing internal stores and detecting food; ATP is the most primitive signal. With increasing density of sensory neurons and glia (the primordial brain) and the emergence of autonomic neural activity throughout the endoderm, transmitters and other signaling molecules enable alimentation before the appearance of innate storage functions. Memory and, ultimately, cognition are prerequisites for processing and producing food to facilitate assimilation and safeguard the supply of nutrients. The gut-brain-gut axis via the vagus nerve is the autonomic neurohumoral pathway integrating these elements of energy homeostasis. Humans uniquely override obligate nutrient needs, eating in the absence of deprivation, resulting in pathological chronic overnutrition arising from dysautonomia. Obesity surgery circumvents powerful redundant mechanisms of alimentation and reduces excess stores of body fat from chronic overnutrition while preventing re-accumulation of fat. All bariatric operations, whether purely restrictive, maldigestive and malabsorptive, or combinations, rely on regulatory mechanisms related to autonomic nervous system function and the brain-gut axis. We review the functional anatomy and the importance of the vagus nerve for maintaining maladaptive chronic overnutrition and describe interventions to abrogate its effects. In aggregate, the preponderance of evidence supported by laboratory and clinical mechanistic studies interrupting abdominal bi-directional vagal transmission demonstrates that the majority of patients report less ""hunger"" and lose weight."
"3";"The authors evaluated the history of treatment in a population of patients awaiting gastric bypass surgery. A standard questionnaire was used to evaluate the history of different therapeutic methods for weight loss in 312 patients between 13 and 70 years of age: 247 (79.2%) women and 66 (20.8%) men. BMI varied between 33.0 to 100.0 kg/m2. The most common therapeutic method for losing weight was the use of formulae containing amphetamines, n=270 (86.5%). Only a tendency could be found towards a difference between women and men regarding amphetamine utilization respectively: 218 (88.3%) vs 52 (80.0%); P=0.066. Patients used formulae for the first time at an average age of 22.5+/-8.0 years old (from 8 to 57 years old). 43.7% (n=118) of the patients who used amphetamines have never received any information about the drug, and 80.6% (n=216) regret using this option. Dry mouth was the most common side-effect reported, n=205 (81%). Women had more frequent reports of depression and tremors than men, 58.6% vs 40.0% (P=0.017) and 44% vs 25% (P=0.011) respectively. Amphetamines were used on a large scale in this population and a high level of side-effects were observed. Women used them more frequently than men, and noted a higher level of side-effects."
"3";"Adolescent obesity has serious immediate and long-term health consequences. There are no effective behavioral or pharmacologic treatments of extreme obesity among adolescents. Bariatric surgery is the most effective means to achieve durable weight loss, with amelioration or resolution of most obesity-related co-morbidities. Surgery should be performed when: 1) the risk of operative complications and of recidivism is lowest; 2) the outcomes of the operation are likely to be the best possible; and 3) there is little need to consider subsequent bariatric surgery for weight regain and reappearance of co-morbidities. A higher BMI is an independent risk factor for operative morbidity and mortality, and is associated with less weight loss and greater likelihood of weight regain. The higher BMI criterion for adolescent bariatric surgery exposes the adolescent to a higher risk for operative death and complications, and suboptimal outcomes following bariatric surgery."
"3";"Surgical therapy for the long-term treatment of obesity (""bariatric surgery"") in individuals whose body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) is 40 or higher or in those who have significant obesity-related comorbidities and a body mass index of 35 or higher is one of few interventions shown to be effective. Many aspects of recent national bariatric surgery trends are unclear, including the ages of individuals undergoing such procedures and the economic burden borne by public vs private payers. Population-adjusted rates of bariatric surgery are rapidly increasing and have economic implications that differ for private vs public payers. We examined hospitalization and charge data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1996 through 2002, representative of national patterns for children and adults. We derived nationally weighted estimates of population-adjusted hospitalization rates and inflation-adjusted charges for bariatric surgery. We also examined the relative economic burden for public vs private payers for bariatric surgery discharges. Population-adjusted rates of bariatric surgery in the overall sample increased more than 7-fold in the study period, from 3.5 per 100 000 US population in 1996 to 24.0 per 100 000 in 2002. During this period, among youth (<20 years old), rates increased from 0.23 per 100 000 to 0.73 per 100 000; and among elderly persons (>65 years old), rates increased from 0.30 per 100 000 to 1.69 per 100 000. The rate increased most dramatically among those aged 20 to 65 years, who composed 97% or more of bariatric surgery discharges annually. Increases in bariatric surgical volume corresponded with increasing economic consequences overall, exceeding USD $2 billion in annual charges by 2002 (mean, USD $29,107 per discharge). Since 2000, private payers have been charged for more than 80% of the national total; annual charges to Medicare and Medicaid have been comparatively modest, but each exceeded USD $100 million by 2002. National rates of bariatric surgery have increased markedly among children and adults, with attendant economic consequences, principally for private insurers. This trend may reflect the dearth of effective primary care and preventive interventions to address the obesity epidemic."
"3";"An increase in national utilization of bariatric surgery correlates with the dissemination of laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Evaluation of Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 1998 through 2002. National database. A total of 188,599 patients underwent bariatric surgery for the treatment of morbid obesity. Annual total number of bariatric operations, the proportion of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs gastroplasty, the proportion of laparoscopic cases, postoperative length of stay, crude in-hospital mortality, and the number of institutions that perform bariatric surgery. Between 1998 and 2002, the number of bariatric operations increased from 12,775 cases to 70,256 cases. The rate of bariatric surgery increased from 6.3 to 32.7 procedures per 100,000 adults. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery increased from 2.1% to 17.9%. The number of bariatric surgeons with membership in the American Society for Bariatric Surgery increased from 258 to 631, and the number of institutions that perform bariatric surgery increased from 131 to 323. During this 5-year period, the annual rate of laparoscopic bariatric surgery increased exponentially (by 44-fold) compared with a linear growth in open bariatric surgery (by 3-fold). Between 1998 and 2002, there was a 450% increase in the number of bariatric operations performed in the United States, a 144% increase in the number of American Society for Bariatric Surgery bariatric surgeons, and a 146% increase in the number of bariatric centers. The growth of laparoscopic bariatric surgery during this 5-year period greatly exceeds that of open bariatric surgery."
"3";"In Asia, the type and main cause of obesity is different than in western society. Therefore, the treatment plan should be differentiated, and the surgery for morbid obesity should be carefully chosen. The early results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) without duodenal switch that has been performed in the Korean population is reported. We retrospectively reviewed 130 patients who underwent LSG from January 2003 to May 2004. 60 of these patients now had >1 year of regular follow-up, and are the subject of this report. LSG was performed through 4 12-mm ports and 1 15-mm port, using the Endo-GIA stapler to create a lesser curve gastric tube over a 48-Fr bougie. For the 60 patients, the postoperative EWL was 71.6+/-21.9% at 6 months and 83.3+/-28.3% at 12 months. At 12 months after LSG, decrease in BMI was 9.2+/-3.7 kg/m2, and median weight loss was 24.6+/-10.0 kg. Dyslipidemia resolved in 75% of patients within 12 months. Diabetes resolved in 100% of patients within 6 months of operation. Hypertension resolved in 92.9% and improved in 100%. Joint pain resolved in 100% within 12 months. Weight loss plateaued at 12 months in the majority of patients. One patient has undergone a malabsorption procedure (duodenal switch) as a second-stage operation. Additional studies and follow-up are needed to determine the best surgical treatment for morbidly obese Asian patients. However, LSG without the second-stage duodenal switch operation has been an effective weight loss operation thus far, in most of the Korean patients."
"3";"The aim of this study was to analyse incidence and efficacy of revisional surgery for failed vertical banded gastroplasty among 458 patients who underwent primary surgery between 1993 and 2003. Staple line disruption was diagnosed in 29 patients and was an indication for restoration of gastroplasty in 10 cases and a conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 19 patients. In two cases of outlet stenosis the band was exchanged to enlarge the collar. In two cases of psychological intolerance of restriction the band was removed because of refusion by patients the conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A substantial weight reduction without statistical differences between restoration and conversion group was recognized. In two patients (20%) after restoration and three patients (15.8%) after conversion we observed weight regain (p=0.57). In cases with removed band weight regained up to its value recorded before surgery. In patients with exchanged band weight was under control. No serious complications were observed. We could conclude that patients with weight regain after vertical banded gastroplasty should be offered conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. When malabsorption is refused, restoration of vertical banded gastroplasty could be also performed. Both of procedures are technically difficult but safe."
"3";"Outcomes of bariatric surgery have been linked to institutional case volume. The objective of our study was to compare outcome of laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) in 2 settings: a low-volume Veterans Affairs (VA) and a high-volume university hospital (UH). Over a period of 27 months, 140 patients underwent RYGB (137 laparoscopic, 3 open) performed by 1 surgeon. Fifty-five were performed at a VA and 85 at a UH with an annual caseload close to 300. The body mass index in both groups was similar, but patients at the VA were older, mostly men, and more likely to have hypertension (HTN), obstructive sleep apnea, and diabetes mellitus (DM). Operative and anesthesia times were significantly longer at the VA. There were no differences in 30-day mortality (none), major morbidity, conversion rates, or reoperation rates. Laparoscopic RYGB can be performed safely at a VA facility despite a higher risk population and low annual volume."
"3";"Several endocrine abnormalities are reported in obesity. Some are considered as causative factors, whereas others are considered to be secondary effects of obesity. In the current study, we explored the changes in cortisol, growth hormone (GH), DHEA, DHEA-S and GH releasing hormone (ghrelin) plasma levels in morbidly obese subjects who lost abundant weight following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). 12 morbidly obese adult patients (15 females), age 21-56 years with BMI 46.0+/-4.4 kg/cm(2), were studied. Blood samples were collected before, 6 and 14 months after LAGB. The levels of DHEA, DHEA-S, cortisol, GH, and ghrelin were determined by commercial kits. Statistical analysis was based on one-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. Mean BMI reduced significantly along the study course (P=.000). Cortisol plasma levels significantly decreased 6 months after surgery (from 541.4+/-242.4 nM to 382.4+/-142.1 nM, P=.004), but did not change further after 14 months (460.2+/-244.9 nM), despite further reduction in BMI (P=.050). GH constantly increased throughout the study from 0.076+/-0.149 ng/ml, to 0.410+/-0.509 ng/ml at 6 months (NS), to 1.224+/-1.738 ng/ml at 14 months after surgery (P=.001). DHEA, DHEA-S and ghrelin plasma levels remained stable throughout the study. GH levels showed a persistent increase during the 14 months following LAGB in association with the weight loss, while a transient decrease in cortisol levels occurred at the 6-months time-point. In contrast, ghrelin, DHEA and DHEA-S were not altered after surgery. The association between GH and cortisol secretion and surgical- and nonsurgical-induced weight reduction merits further investigation."
"3";"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) is associated with a significant learning curve. We hypothesize that differences in surgeon and assistant training backgrounds may significantly impact outcomes during the learning curve. Retrospective analysis was performed on patients undergoing LRYGBP at an academic medical center between January 1998 and August 2003. Operations were performed by surgeons with different training backgrounds: without formal laparoscopic fellowship (S1, n=95); immediately following laparoscopic fellowship (S2, n=100); and with extensive laparoscopic experience post fellowship (S3, n=88). First assistants were attendings, fellows, or residents. The variables analyzed included demographics, operative times, estimated blood loss (EBL), rate of conversion, length of stay (LOS), ICU stay, re-operation/re-admission rate, and complications. Results were analyzed by ANOVA and Fisher's exact test. There were significant differences among surgeons of different training backgrounds in EBL, LOS, rate of ICU admission, and intraoperative and late complications rates. Among assistants of different training levels, there were significant differences in operative time, EBL, intraoperative complication rates and re-admission rates. Differences in training background of the surgeons resulted in significant differences in outcome, including EBL, LOS, ICU admission and intraoperative and late complication rates. Lower assistant training levels significantly impacted efficiency through lengthened operative times and increased EBL, as well as increased intraoperative complication rates and re-admission rates. Our results suggested that participating in a laparoscopic fellowship and operating with a more experienced assistant may improve outcomes during the learning curve."
"3";"This study aimed to determine whether advanced age or sex was predictive of adverse outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The Pennsylvania State Discharge Database was searched for records of morbidly obese patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The SASs MIXED Procedure was used to test whether mortality alone or adverse outcomes (postoperative complications, nonroutine hospital transfer and mortality) were significantly related to sex or advanced age (>50 years). The presence of comorbidities was used as a blocking variable. Between 1999 and 2001, 4,685 patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in Pennsylvania, of which 82% were female and 20% were older than 50 years of age. Comorbidities were present in 71% of patients. Twenty-eight deaths (0.6%) and 813 adverse outcomes (17.4%) occurred. Mortality was greater in males than in females (1.2% vs. 0.47%, P<0.05) without comorbid interaction. Mortality did not increase with age. Adverse outcomes were related to both sexes (24% male, 16% female, P<0.05) and age (< or = 50, 16% vs. > 50, 23%, P<0.05) with a small comorbid interaction. Adverse outcomes are more frequent among males and older patients and are influenced by comorbidities. Male patients have a higher mortality that was not affected by the presence of comorbidities."
"3";"Enhanced insulin sensitivity is commonly seen following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) whereas symptomatic hypoglycemia post-RYGB seems to occur infrequently. It is unclear how different plasma glucose and insulin responses are in patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia (SX-RYGB) versus those who remain asymptomatic (ASX-RYGB), nor when compared with non-surgical controls with varying degrees of insulin sensitivity. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were determined following a 75-g oral glucose challenge in five groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic patients following RYGB (n = 9 each) and overweight/obese controls, divided into three subgroups (n = 30 each) on the basis of degree of insulin sensitivity measured by the insulin suppression test. SX-RYGB group had higher 30-min glucose after oral glucose compared with the ASX-RYGB group (p = 0.04). The two groups did not differ in peak glucose and insulin concentrations, nadir glucose concentration, or insulin-to-glucose ratio 30 min after oral glucose. These values were significantly different from the three control groups, and peak insulin concentrations post-RYGB were increased at every degree of insulin sensitivity as compared with the control groups. Plasma glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose in patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia post-RYGB are minimally different when compared to individuals who remain asymptomatic, and both groups demonstrate hyperinsulinemia out of proportion to their degree of insulin sensitivity."
"3";"Bariatric surgery can result in massive, rapid weight loss. Patients who undergo this surgery can be left with significant facial and neck skin redundancy and may request restorative facial plastic surgery. Optimal results require a thorough understanding of the unique physiologic, metabolic, and anatomic findings in these patients. Modifications of standard rhytidectomy techniques are necessary to suit the specific features of the patient after bariatric surgery."
"3";"The authors evaluated the predictive efficacy of preoperative resting energy expenditure (REE) on long-term weight loss maintenance following vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). In the long-term following VBG, low energy expenditure could lead to regain of weight, and thereby REE data might be a reliable predictor of long-term weight outcomes. A prospective study was conducted, taking into account the relationship between preoperative REE values and the results at 3 and 5 years following VBG in terms of both weight loss and success of the operation. Long-term weight loss and outcome following VBG appeared to be completely independent of the preoperative REE. Preoperative REE cannot predict long-term weight outcome following VBG."
"3";"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is well tolerated and effective in ameliorating diseases common to morbidly obese patients. A potential drawback, however, is the risk for stomal ulcers, probably due to acid and peptic digestion of the mucosa in the proximal Roux limb. In 23 RYGBP patients (mean BMI 45 kg/m(2), age 39 years), the gastro-jejunostomy was performed by circular stapler and the gastric suture ring retrieved for histological examination. 13 consecutive patients received our standard totally transected 4 x 3 cm proximal gastric pouch. The anvil was passed transgastricly and reference biopsies were taken from the gastrotomy in the corpus of the stomach. In the last 10 patients, the pouch size was reduced to 2 x 3 cm by a modified surgical technique. All suture rings from the standard pouches consisted of corpus-fundus mucosa with a large amount of parietal cells, histologically identical to the reference biopsies from the gastrotomy. Also, the 10 suture rings from the modified small pouches contained corpus-fundus mucosa. In 5 of these samples, cardiac mucosa was found, but only in a small segment (6 mm). In addition, 3 patients had esophageal epithelium in the suture ring. The proximal pouch invariably contains acid-producing parietal cells. In order to reduce acid production and, hence, the risk of stomal ulcers, the pouch has to be made as small as possible."
"3";"2 cases of proteinuria in obese non-diabetic young males, both corresponding to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are presented. Effective reduction of body weight by bariatric surgery was followed by sustained remission of proteinuria allowing significant reduction or total removal of blockers of the reninangiotensin- system."
"3";"Gastric bypass has repeatedly been shown to improve and even cure type 2 diabetes by substantially improving insulin resistance. The mechanism by which it achieves this is not currently known, but some have hypothesized that there may be important humoral effects brought about by the bypass of the stomach, duodenum or proximal jejunum. A better understanding of the time course of the changes in insulin resistance after surgery might assist our understanding of potential mechanisms. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed in 26 severely obese patients on the morning of gastric bypass surgery and again 6 days later. In addition insulin resistance was assessed in 71 patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method before surgery, and again at 6 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients were divided into 3 groups for analysis: diabetics, impaired glucose tolerance and normal glucose tolerance. All 3 groups of patients were noted to have insulin resistance prior to surgery. This was greatest in the diabetic patients, as indicated by HOMA. There was marked loss of/improvement in insulin resistance within 6 days of gastric bypass by both IVGTT and HOMA methods in all groups, which was maintained over the 12-month period. The study included 31 diabetic patients, of whom only 3 required medication following hospital discharge. The changes in insulin resistance seen after gastric bypass, which are responsible for the resolution or improvement of type 2 diabetes occur within 6 days of the surgery, before any appreciable weight loss has occurred. This finding has implications for our understanding of the mechanism of insulin resistance in severely obese patients and is consistent with a humoral mechanism emanating from the GI tract."
"3";"Postoperative leaks after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are a source of morbidity and mortality. Any intervention that would decrease leak rates after LRYGB would be useful. This investigation tested the hypothesis that postoperative leak rates are lower after LRYGB with the routine use of intraoperative endoscopy (EN). Consecutive patients who underwent LRYGB were included. Intraoperative leak testing with air and methylene blue through an orogastric tube (OG) was used in the first 200 patients. Intraoperative endoscopy was used after the first 200 patients. There were 400 patients in this study. Preoperative demographics did not differ between groups. The intraoperative leak rate of the EN group was double the OG group (8 vs 4%; P = not significant), although the difference was not statistically significant. The OG group had a postoperative leak rate of 4 per cent with a mortality rate of 1 per cent. The EN group had a postoperative leak rate of 0.5 per cent with a mortality rate of 0 per cent. The difference in leak rates was statistically significant (P < 0.04). Despite the issues of learning curve, EN demonstrates more intraoperative leaks than OG, indicating EN may be a more sensitive test than OG. Routine use of EN is associated with less postoperative leaks after LRYGB."
"3";"Morbid obesity (MO) has reached epidemic proportions and is a major health problem in developed nations. In the adolescent with MO, early intervention can minimize obesity-related comorbidities, avoid premature mortality, improve quality of life, and prevent obesity-related diseases as these patients mature into adulthood. The primary surgical treatment of adolescent patients meeting National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery has been the gastric bypass (GB). Although GB has led to weight loss and improvement of comorbid conditions, concerns remain over the high incidence of postoperative complications and life-style-altering long-term sequelae of gastrointestinal tract reconstruction. Based on the excellent results from international adult series as well as the authors' own experience of more than 300 adult patients, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) as an alternative to GB to eligible adolescents was offered. After medical, psychologic, and nutritional screening, 4 patients (ages 17-19 years) with a body mass index of 40 or more (range, 40-61) who failed medical attempts at weight loss were selected for LAGB. The operative time was 40 to 90 minutes. All patients were discharged on the day of surgery. There were no early complications. One patient had cholecystitis 6 months after surgery requiring laparoscopic cholecystectomy. For the 4 patients, the amount of excess weight loss was 57% at 30 months, 34% at 12 months, 87% at 7 months, and 15% at 4 months, respectively. In this preliminary series of the US experience in the use of LAGB for the management of adolescents with MO, the lack of operative morbidity, short operative time/hospital stay, and encouraging initial weight loss mirror the adult experience and illustrate that the LAGB is a safe and effective alternative to GB. These encouraging results support further evaluation of LAGB as a surgical option in a comprehensive adolescent weight loss program."
"3";"The important weight loss due to bariatric surgery allows to improve and even correct, a great part of the comorbidities induced by obesity, as well as quality of life, and to reduce the coming out of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in operated patients. The impact of surgical treatment on the patient's health and quality of life also allows to reduce direct and indirect costs of morbid obesity. However, its effects on mortality have not yet been clearly proved. The preoperative evaluation and the long term follow-up by a skilled team are essential to reduce potential complications, especially on the nutritional field and the risks of recovered weight linked to binge eating disorders."
"3";"Impaired blood pressure (BP) variation, often found in obesity and hypertension, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The effect of obesity surgery on BP variation is unknown. We performed this study to investigate the effect of gastric bypass surgery on circadian BP variation in morbidly obese hypertensive subjects. The study group consisted of eight patients (mean age 35.0 +/- 9.1 years), with impaired circadian BP rhythm. Controls were eight well-matched subjects (34.6 +/- 9.8 years) with normal BP rhythm. All patients underwent gastric bypass surgery. The 24-h ambulatory BP measurements were performed before (baseline) and 8 weeks after gastric bypass surgery. Mean body weight in the study group and controls decreased from baseline of 129.0 +/- 21.9 kg and 134.1 +/- 27.2 kg to 116.7 +/- 21.1 kg (by 9.5% +/- 2.1%) and 121.6 +/- 25.7 kg (by 9.3% +/- 1.7%) after the surgery, respectively (P < .0001 v baseline). Mean 24-h, daytime, and night-time BP values decreased significantly and similarly in both groups. In the study group mean 24-h systolic and diastolic BP decreased from 154.7 +/- 12.3 mm Hg and 105.6 +/- 8.1 mm Hg to 138.5 +/- 9.3 mm Hg and 90.8 +/- 6.7 mm Hg and in controls from 158.2 +/- 16.5 mm Hg and 106.2 +/- 10.0 mm Hg to 136.3 +/- 10.8 mm Hg and 92.9 +/- 6.3 mm Hg (P < .0001 v baseline), respectively. Circadian BP rhythm in the study group returned to the normal profile (mean systolic nocturnal fall increased from 4.0% +/- 2.4% to 16.4% +/- 4.0% and diastolic, from 5.1% +/- 3.0% to 17.3% +/- 5.5%; P < .0001 v baseline), whereas it remained normal in the controls. Surgery-induced body weight loss in morbidly obese hypertensive subjects with impaired circadian BP variation is not only associated with BP reduction, but also with the restoration of normal BP rhythm."
"3";"To compare the prevalence of effort-related calf pain in an obese and a general population and to analyze the incidence of and recovery from such pain after surgical and conventional obesity treatment. A random sample of 1135 subjects from a general population was compared with 6328 obese subjects in the Swedish Obese Subjects study. Obese subjects were followed longitudinally, and information about calf pain was obtained from surgically and conventionally treated patients for up to 6 years. In both sexes, self-reported calf pain was more common in the obese than in the general population [odds ratios (ORs) 5.0 and 4.0 in men and women, respectively, p<0.001]. Obese patients undergoing surgery had a lower 6-year incidence of calf pain compared with the conventionally treated control group (ORs 0.39 and 0.61, p<0.05). Among subjects reporting symptoms at baseline, the 6-year recovery rate was higher in the surgical group compared with the control group (ORs 15.3 and 5.9, p<0.001). Obese subjects have markedly more problems with effort-related calf pain than the general population. Surgical obesity treatment reduces the long-term risk of developing claudication symptoms and increases the likelihood of recovering from such symptoms."
"3";"We report an uncommon case of a life-threatening abdominal wall hematoma after liposuction. One day after liposuction surgery, the patient experienced syncope and low blood pressure. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an extravasation in an abdominal wall hematoma. Transcatheter embolization was done successfully, without complication. Life-threatening complications caused by abdominal wall hematomas after liposuction are very rare. There have been few reports in the literature of life-threatening hemorrhagic complications after liposuction that were treated by transcatheter embolization."
"3";"The One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass has been developed from the Mini Gastric Bypass procedure as originally described by Robert Rutledge. The modification of the original procedure consists of making a latero-lateral gastro-jejunal anastomosis instead of a termino-lateral anastomosis, as is carried out as described in the original procedure. The rationale for these changes is to try to reduce exposure of the gastric mucosa to biliopancreatic secretions because of their potentially carcinogenic effects with longer term exposure, which is the major criticism of the original technique. If we fix the jejunal loop to the gastric pouch some centimetres up to the gastro-jejunal anastomosis the biliopancreatic secretions have less possibility of coming into the gastric cavity (gravity force). Furthermore, if the anastomosis is latero-lateral this possibility is reduced even more. In addition, the intestinal loop reinforces the staple line against disruption, and also the gastric pouch against dilatation."
"3";"The level of serum leptin was studied in 20 patients before and after liposuction carried out for excessive subcutaneous fatty tissue. The dynamics of indices depending on the volume of the ablated fatty tissue was analyzed. It was found that in most patients the level of blood serum leptin correlated with the body mass and fatty tissue index. A removal of limited volumes of fatty tissue results in the elevated level of blood serum leptin. The aspiration of great volume of fatty tissue is followed by the primary decrease of the leptin level which further reaches the initial level and even surpasses it."
"3";"Iron absorption is decreased in some individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery. We evaluated measures of iron metabolism and therapeutic phlebotomy in 3 adults with hemochromatosis and HFE C282Y homozygosity who underwent bariatric surgery. 1 male and 1 female had surgery before diagnosis of hemochromatosis (jejuno-ileal bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, respectively); neither had iron overload. Another man was treated with serial phlebotomy to induce iron depletion; later, he underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. His maintenance phlebotomy requirement for hemochromatosis decreased substantially (on average approximately 1 unit each 71 days before surgery, and approximately 1 unit each 173 days after surgery). None of these patients developed iron deficiency, and none took supplemental iron. Iron absorption is decreased in some patients with hemochromatosis and HFE C282Y homozygosity after bariatric surgery, but their risk of developing iron deficiency may be diminished."
"3";"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most commonly performed bariatric operation in the USA. Anastomotic leak is one of the devastating complications in this operation. By using fibrin sealant around the anastomosis, surgeons can achieve better hemostasis around the suture-line and prevent or decrease the incidence of anastomotic leaks. This paper discusses the biological and clinical evidence for use of fibrin sealant in laparoscopic gastric bypass."
"3";"Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a potential perioperative complication after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The surgeon performing laparoscopic gastric bypass should understand the need for early recognition and management of this complication, as it can be life-threatening. This paper discusses the incidence and clinical presentation of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanisms for hemorrhage, management options, and possible methods of prevention."
"2";"Conservative treatment has been shown in long-term studies to be ineffective in morbid obesity. Surgical treatments break down into restrictive, malabsorptive, combined restrictive and malabsorptive or motility-reducing procedures. Laparascopic implantation of an adjustable gastric band is an efficient restrictive measure for treating the majority of patients with this condition. The adjustable gastric band enables weight loss and food intake to be adapted to the individual patient's need. Eighty percent to 90% of these patients can expect to lose 55-70% of their excess weight. Vertical banded gastroplasty is losing ground among the restrictive options. Preliminary experiences are encouraging but the long term results are disappointing when assessed by the standard criteria. Gastric bypass is gaining ground in Europe and a standard procedure in USA. This operation is estimated to give 70-80% excess weight loss and provide better quality of life than restrictive procedures. The biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch combines a sleeve gastrectomy with a duodenoileal switch to achieve maximum weight loss. Consistent excess weight loss between 70 and 80% is achieved with acceptable decreased long-term nutritional complications. The laparoscopic approach to this procedure has successfully created a surgical technique with optimum benefit and minimal morbidity, especially in the super obese patient. Intra-gastric stimulation is the least invasive surgical procedure at present. However, the excess weight loss is lowest with this method at only 32% in the first 2 years after the operation. Provided safety recommendations are observed, laparoscopic operations for obesity are fairly low-risk. The mortality rate in centres with experienced staff is less than 0.3%. Surgical treatment for obesity has proved that it is the best and most effective means of preventing the life-threatening complications and serious degenerative problems associated with morbid obesity. There is no one operation that is effective for all patients."
"3";"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the gold standard for treating morbid obesity in this country. The totally laparoscopic performance of this procedure, although quite demanding and technically difficult, has revolutionized it; and the demand for it has skyrocketed. We describe 2 cases where it became necessary to convert the Y into a ""W"" while performing the procedure. A laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was attempted on 2 patients, 1 male and 1 female, both with body mass indexes greater than 40. During creation of the side to side jejunojejunostomy, ie, the Y, it became obvious that stenosis or obstruction would result. This area was partially resected and an additional side to side anastomosis was formed, creating a ""W."" The operative time was 205 minutes and 180 minutes, respectively, which compared favorably with the average operative time of 151 minutes in that quartile of patients (patients #101-#150). Both patients had normal upper gastrointestinal and small bowel contrast x-rays the day following surgery and were started on clear liquids. They were discharged later that day. Weight loss of 119 lb at 8 months and 80 lb at 6 months was documented, respectively, with no gastrointestinal sequelae. If problems are encountered when creating the Y of a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a laparoscopic Roux-en-W may be performed. It appears safe, technically feasible, and with a postoperative course not unlike that of the standard approach."
"3";"The authors reviewed the benefits of routine placement of closed drains in the peritoneal cavity following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). The purpose of the study was to determine whether routine closed abdominal drainage provides diagnostic and therapeutic advantages in the presence of complications such as bleeding and leaks. The medical records of 593 consecutive patients who had undergone LRYGBP from July 2001 through May 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. In all cases, antecolic antegastric LRYGBP was performed. Two 19-Fr Blake closed suction drains were left in place, one at the gastrojejunostomy and the other at the jejunojejunostomy. The incidence of bleeding and leaks was reviewed, and the utility of the drains relative to diagnosis and management was evaluated. Bleeding presented in 24 patients (4.4%); in 8, the diagnosis was based on increased sanguinous output from the drain and decreased hematocrit. None of the patients with intraabdominal bleeding required reoperation. Of the 10 patients (1.68%) who presented with leaks, the diagnosis was made within 48 hours postoperatively in 5 patients (50%), based on the characteristics of the drain output. Nonoperative management with drainage and total parenteral nutrition was accomplished in 5 (50%) of the 10 patients with leaks. There was no mortality in the series. The routine use of abdominal drains after LRYGBP appears to be beneficial. Drains allowed early diagnosis of complications and in most cases, the successful treatment of leaks. When bleeding is suspected or documented, appropriate volume replacement therapy is mandatory to maintain adequate hemodynamic parameters. Drain output may orient the surgeon to take preventive measures such as discontinuing anticoagulation and early fluid resuscitation. In this series, in most cases the bleeding spontaneously stopped and no further surgical management was required."
"3";"Obesity adversely affects cardiac function, increases the risk factors for coronary heart disease, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The risk of developing coronary heart disease is directly related to the concomitant burden of obesity-related risk factors. Modest weight loss can improve diastolic function and affect the entire cluster of coronary heart disease risk factors simultaneously. This statement from the American Heart Association Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism reviews the relationship between obesity and the cardiovascular system, evaluates the effect of weight loss on coronary heart disease risk factors and coronary heart disease, and provides practical weight management treatment guidelines for cardiovascular healthcare professionals. The data demonstrate that weight loss and physical activity can prevent and treat obesity-related coronary heart disease risk factors and should be considered a primary therapy for obese patients with cardiovascular disease."
"3";"Morbid obesity is associated with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and weight loss is fundamental to improve glycemic control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of weight reduction during the late postoperative period (> or = 12 months) after gastric bypass on the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Fasting glycemia (glucose oxidase) and glycohemoglobin A1c (enzymatic fluorescence, reference value: 4-6%) were determined before and after surgery. Results were compared by the Student t-test for paired samples (P <0.05). 23 women and 8 men with diabetes, with a mean follow-up of 27.2 months and a mean age of 42.5 years (30-68), were studied. Before surgery, mean +/- SD weight, BMI, excess weight, glycemia and glycohemoglobin were 135.9+/-11.6 kg, 51.8+/-6.4 kg/m2, 68.3+/-14.5 kg, 173+/-71.2 mg/dl, and 7.4+/-1.9%, respectively. After surgery, mean weight, BMI, excess weight, percent weight loss, percent excess weight loss, glycemia and glycohemoglobin were 89.7+/-8.8 kg, 35+/-4.5 kg/m2, 24.6+/-11.6 kg, 32.6%+/-1.8 (12.6-46.5%), 64.7+/-18.3%, 98+/-17.3 mg/dl (P <0.01), and 5.4+/-1.0% (P <0.05), respectively. Oral anti-diabetic drug and/or insulin treatment was discontinued in 89.2% of the patients. After surgery, 90.3% of the patients maintained glycohemoglobin A1c levels <7.0%. Weight loss led to a significant and sustained improvement of glycemic control in these patients submitted to bariatric surgery."
"2";"The indication of bariatric surgery as therapeutic procedure for morbid obese patients requires the application of selection criteria which deal with the degree of obesity, associated complications and previous failure of conventional therapy. Alcohol or drug addiction and concomitant serious disease are contraindications for bariatric surgery. Before operation, a full assessment is needed to identify possible eating behaviour disturbances and associated comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease, sleep apnoea, metabolic and psychiatric alterations which might induce intra and postoperative complications. Surgical techniques can be classified as restrictive, malabsortive and mixed procedures. Gastroplasty and adjustable gastric banding are restrictive techniques, which are indicated in obese patients with body mass index less than 45 kg/m2. Mixed techniques are the most used procedures. They include gastric by-pass which causes a reduction of 60-70% of weight excess, biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch which can eliminate a 75% of body weight excess. Following bariatric surgery a dramatic improvement in associated comorbidity can be demonstrated, specially in what refers to diabetes, hypertension, dislipidaemia and apnoea. Postoperative mortality is around 1-2%. Peritonitis and venous thromboembolism are the most serious complications. Postoperative follow-up should be lifelong and requires a progressive nutrition planning and vitamin supplementation."
"3";"Once an obese patient has failed attempts at diet modification, physical activity, pharmacologic treatment, and possibly even complementary and alternative therapies, the next step is to consider surgical management. Treatment plans must be customized for individual patients and should involve evaluation by the primary care provider, a dietician, psychologist, and surgeon. Then depending on the individual's needs, comorbidities, and candidacy, a specific surgical intervention may be necessary. These procedures are restrictive, malabsorptive, and a combination of both. Each procedure has its own short-term and long-term complications and must be monitored for the rest of the individual's life."
"3";"Life-threatening small bowel obstruction (SBO) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can present with surprisingly minimal laboratory and plain x-ray findings. Based on a 10-year (1994-2003) experience of 1,409 open distal gastric bypasses, we present clinical and radiological findings in 29 patients with unusual forms of bowel obstruction. A retrospective chart review was conducted. A radiologist experienced in reviewing these in gastric bypass patients reviewed all computed tomography (CT) scans. CT findings: The normal appearance and 7 recurring patterns of small bowel obstruction were identified. These include: 1) intussusception, 2) internal hernia through Petersen's space, 3) through Petersen's space and the mesenteric defect at enteroenterostomy, 4) through the mesenteric defect from the entero-enterostomy, 5) isolated biliary limb obstruction, 6) segmental non-anastomotic ischemia, and 7) internal hernia through bands. Clinical findings: 1 had peritonitis, and 1 had free air on plain film. WBC count was normal in 20/27 patients (74%) including 5/6 (83%) with dead bowel. 9/14 patients (62%) had ""non-specific"" findings on x-rays. 7 of these had an internal hernia (2 with volvulus and 2 with dead bowel), 1 had biliopancreatic limb obstruction, and 1 had peritonitis. Patients with SBO after distal gastric bypass may present with vague complaints and confusing laboratory and non-specific findings on x-rays. Delayed diagnosis can have catastrophic consequences. CT imaging with oral and intravenous contrast can be life-saving, and should be obtained in all gastric bypass patients with abdominal pain, particularly when all other parameters seem ""normal"". Unexplained abdominal pain should prompt exploration."
"1";"Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and gastric bypass (GBP) are the two bariatric procedures recommended by NIH consensus conference. Recent advancement in laparoscopic (L) techniques has made LVBG and LGBP alternatives for the conventional open approach. From December 2000 to February 2002, 80 patients (24 men and 56 women; mean age 32 years, range 18-57) with morbid obesity (mean BMI 43.2 kg/m(2), range 36-59.8) were enrolled in a prospective trial and randomly assigned to LVBG or LGBP. Changes in quality of life were assessed using the Gastro-intestinal quality of life index (GIQLI). The conversion rate was zero for LVBG and 2.5% (1/40) for LGBP. There has been no mortality. Surgical time was significantly longer for LGBP (209 minvs 126 min for LVBG, P<0.001). Mean hospital stay was 3.5 days for the LVBG vs 5.7 days for LGBP (P<0.001). Postoperative analgesic usage was also less for LVBG patients (mean dose 1.4 vs 2.4, P<0.05). Early complication rate was higher in the LGBP group (17.8% vs 2.5%, P<0.001). All 3 major complications were in the LGBP group, of which 2 were related to anastomotic leakage (5%). Late complications consisted of upper GI bleeding, stenosis and others observed in 4 LGBP patients (10%) and 2 LVBG patients (5%). Mean follow-up was 20 months (range 18 to 30). BMI fell significantly in both groups, with significant improvement of obesity-related co-morbidities. LGBP had significantly better excess weight loss than LVBG (62.9% vs 55.4% at 1 year and 71.4% vs 53.1% at 2 years), as well as lower BMI than LVBG (29.6 vs 31.1 at 1 year and 28.5 vs 31.9 at 2 years). There was no difference in the reduction of obesity-related laboratory abnormalities at 1 year except a lower hemoglobin in LGBP (11.8 vs 13.8, P<0.05). Preoperative GIQLI scores were similar between the groups; however, at 1 year, LGBP patients had better GIOLI scores than LVBG patients (121 vs 106, P<0.01). LVBG had improvement in physical condition, social function and emotional conditioning but deterioration in GI symptoms which resulted in no increase in total GIQLI score. LGBP was a time-consuming demanding technique with a higher early complication rate compared with LVBG. Although both operations resulted in significant weight reduction and decrease in obesity-related co-morbidities, LGBP had a trend of greater weight loss and significantly better GIQLI than LVBG at the cost of a significant long-term trace element deficiency state. Each patient should be individualized for the operations according to the patient's decision."
"3";"Gastric bypass surgery, which involves the production of a reduced stomach pouch,has been shown to markedly suppress circulating ghrelin concentrations. Since bypassing the ghrelin-producing cell population may be relevant to the disruption of fundic-derived factors participating in food intake signaling, the effect of weight loss induced by either adjustable gastric banding (AGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) was studied. 16 matched obese patients [35.0 + 2.4 years; initial body weight 124.8 +/- 5.7 kg; body mass index (BMI) 47.1 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2)] in whom similar weight loss had been achieved by either AGB (n=7), RYGBP (n=6) or BPD (n=3) were studied. Blood was obtained for biochemical and hormonal analyses. Body composition was assessed by air-displacement-plethysmography. Comparable weight loss (AGB: 26.1 +/- 5.1 kg; RYGBP: 32.1 +/- 5.0; BPD: 31.7 +/- 6.1; P=NS) and decrease in percentage body fat (AGB: 10.0 +/- 1.5%; RYGBP: 14.2 +/- 2.8; BPD: 10.3 +/- 1.0; P=NS) induced by bariatric surgery exerted significantly different (P=0.004) effects on plasma ghrelin concentrations, depending on the surgical procedure applied (AGB: 480 +/- 78 pg/ml; RYGBP: 117 +/- 34; BPD: 406 +/- 86). Without significant differences in BMI, body fat, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and leptin levels, patients who had undergone the RYGBP exhibited statistically significant diminished circulating fasting plasma ghrelin concentrations compared with the other two bariatric techniques which conserve direct contact of the fundus with ingested food (P=0.003 vs AGB and P=0.020 vs BPD). Fasting circulating ghrelin concentrations in patients undergoing diverse bariatric operations depend on the degree of dysfunctionality of the fundus."
"3";"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a surgical option that involves placing a silicone band circumferentially around the uppermost aspect of the stomach. The band creates a small proximal pouch that empties slowly resulting in early satiety and a decreased appetite. The band is attached to an access port that is secured to the rectus muscle and can be accessed percutaneously in the office with a needle. Injection of saline into the port results in tightening of the band. This is performed on an individual basis according to weight loss and appetite. Band adjustments are required approximately 5-6 times in the first year and 2-3 times in the second year. Weight loss is gradual, averaging 1-2 lb/week during the first 2 years after surgery."
"3";"Physical, emotional, and social functioning are impaired in obesity. It is unknown whether and, if so, to what extent and in which domain obese subjects who lose weight may catch up to normal-weight levels. Our objective was to compare the health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) of obese subjects with that of a normal-weight reference group before and 1 year after a weight loss program that centered around laparoscopic and open gastric banding. An HRQL questionnaire consisting of a battery of both generic and specific measures was administered to 50 morbidly obese subjects on 2 occasions and to 100 healthy, normal-weight subjects, matched for age, gender, education, and vocational training. In addition to weight loss and health gain, the influences of achieved weight loss goals, satisfaction with outcome and operative approach (laparoscopy/laparotomy) were assessed. Quality-of-life was significantly impaired in obese subjects. With a substantial weight loss of 35 kg and 42% loss of excessive weight, and correction of disturbed metabolic parameters, they significantly improved in general well-being, health distress, and perceived attractiveness, approaching halfway the values of a normal-weight reference group. Improvement in values for depression and self-regard lagged behind. In physical activity, they bypassed the reference group. Days of sick leave decreased to the level of the reference group. Improvements in HRQL paralleled the rate of weight loss. Personal satisfaction and surgical approach were of minor influence. The obese subjects' impaired physical and social functioning improved considerably, catching up midway to normal-weight reference values after weight loss. Psychologic amelioration lagged behind. Whether the latter will catch up later and physical/social improvements will be maintained is the subject of further studies."
"3";"The use of conscious sedation is rapidly gaining acceptance and popularity in plastic surgery. At the present time, many procedures are performed using intravenous sedation and local anesthesia. The purpose of this article was to examine the safety and outcome of full abdominoplasties performed under conscious sedation at the authors' institution. Over a 6-year period from 1997 to 2002, 266 abdominoplasties were performed by the two senior authors. One hundred thirteen of these (42 percent) were performed under a general or regional anesthetic because a concurrent procedure was performed that precluded the use of conscious sedation (64 hysterectomies, 18 hernia repairs, six urogynecologic procedures, 10 breast reductions, and one laparoscopic cholecystectomy) or because of patient and surgeon preference (14 cases). One hundred fifty-three abdominoplasties (58 percent) were performed under conscious sedation using intravenous midazolam and fentanyl along with a local anesthetic. No patients had an unplanned conversion to deep sedation or general anesthesia. Eighty percent of these cases were performed with a concurrent procedure (80 liposuctions, 19 breast augmentations, 20 mastopexies, three capsulotomies, and 13 varied facial aesthetic procedures). In addition, 12 patients had concurrent hernia repairs (five ventral and seven umbilical) under conscious sedation. Mean follow-up was 10 months (range, 1 to 56 months). There were no intraoperative complications and no major postoperative complications. The minor complication rate was 11.1 percent (10 seromas requiring needle aspiration in the office, three superficial wound infections, two cases of marginal skin necrosis, one stitch abscess, and one pseudobursa requiring reexcision). Seven revisions were performed for suboptimal scars (5 percent). The results of this study demonstrate that abdominoplasties can be performed under conscious sedation in a safe and cost-effective manner for almost all patients. This type of procedure is well tolerated, has a low complication rate, and has high patient satisfaction. Increasing experience and small modifications in local anesthesia and surgical technique have strengthened the authors' conviction that conscious sedation is the preferred method of anesthesia for most patients undergoing abdominoplasty."
"3";"A 43-year-old man presented 10 days after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with abdominal pain radiating to the back. Investigation revealed a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein. The patient was found to have a hypercoagulable state. He responded successfully to anticoagulant therapy."
"3";"Postoperative complications and nutritional deficits resulting from bariatric surgery can lead to severe vitamin-deficiency states, such as Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Patients with acute WE generally present with the classic clinical triad of inattentiveness, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. We describe a patient who presented with acute WE at 2 months after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Initial MRI of the brain demonstrated the characteristic injuries of WE, and repeat imaging showed resolution after 4 months of thiamine supplementation, at which time the patient had normal gait but persistent memory deficits. Even with early recognition and aggressive therapy, acute WE commonly results in permanent disability due to the irreversible cytotoxic effects on specific regions of the brain. Since the clinical onset of acute WE follows a predictable time-course in post-bariatric surgery patients with malnutrition, we recommend prevention by administration of parenteral thiamine beginning at 6 weeks postoperatively in malnourished patients."
"3";"In 2001 a new device for surgical weight loss was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (Lap-Band, Inamed Health). We describe initial results of laparoscopic gastric banding for morbid obesity in two American academic centers. Prospective data was collected on consecutive morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and evaluated retrospectively. Four hundred forty-five consecutive patients underwent Lap-Band from May 2001 through December 2002. The 103 men and 341 women had an average age of 42.1 years (range 17-72 years) and an average body mass index (BMI) of 49.6 kg/m2 (range 35.2-92.2 kg/m2). One operation required conversion to laparotomy due to bleeding; the rest were completed laparoscopically. Mean length of stay was 1.1 days (range 1-10 days). There was one death. Additional complications included band slippage in 14 patients (3.1%), gastric obstruction without slip in 12 (2.7%), port migration in 2 (0.4%), tubing disconnections in 3 (0.7%), and port infection in 5 (1.1%). Two bands (0.4%) were removed due to intraabdominal abscess 2 months after placement. There was one band erosion (0.2%) and no clinically significant esophageal dilation. Ninety-nine patients have 1-year follow-up and have lost an average of 44.3% excess body weight. Laparoscopic gastric banding has much to offer the morbidly obese. We present data showing weight loss rivaling gastric bypass and acceptably low complications. These results parallel success with this device outside America."
"3";"Gastric slippage is a well-described complication of gastric banding. The Heliogast band is equipped with a locking mechanism that enables its straightforward reopening and repositioning. Our experience with Heliogast band salvage after anterior slippage is reported. The study sample comprised 418 consecutive patients who underwent 2-step laparoscopic gastric banding with the Lap-Band first (n=235) followed with the Heliogast band (n=183). Gastric slippage was diagnosed by symptoms of dysphagia and vomiting and was confirmed with Gastrografin swallow. Patients who did not respond to conservative treatment were laparoscopically reoperated. In the Heliogast group, the band was dissected free, unlocked, and repositioned. In the Lap-Band group, when reopening proved impossible, the band was removed with or without replacement. 10 patients (2.4%) underwent reoperation for anterior slippage, 5 with a Lap-Band (2.1%) and 5 with a Heliogast band (2.7%). Band repositioning was feasible in all 5 patients in the Heliogast group, but in only one of the patients in the Lap-Band group; in the others, the band was removed. Band repositioning was confirmed radiologically. No postoperative complications were recorded, and all patients were discharged on the first day after surgery. At a median 10 months' follow-up after Heliogast repositioning, all patients had satisfactory weight loss. Laparoscopic Heliogast band salvage after anterior slippage is comparatively simple and safe, with excellent postoperative results and no interference with continued weight loss. This constitutes an important means of management for the bariatric surgeon."
"3";"To be certified for laparoscopic placement of adjustable gastric banding, surgeons must have advanced laparoscopic experience. Despite previous exposure to other kinds of laparoscopy, there may a learning curve specific to Lap-Band placement. Sixty consecutive patients were prospectively separated into two groups: the first 30 patients operated on (group 1) and the second 30 patients operated on (group 2). Both groups were similar statistically in regard to gender, age, and body mass index. Operative time for group 1 was 79 +/- 31.1 min. There were 11 (37%) complications in 10 patients. Operative time for group 2 was 59 +/- 19.9 min. There were two complications (7%). All operations were completed laparoscopically. Operative time was significantly lower in group 2 ( t-test; p = 004). Complications were also significantly lower (chi-square; p = 0.005). The number of reoperations was also reduced and approached statistical significance (chi-square; p = 0.054). Readmissions, although reduced, were not statistically significant. There were no deaths in either group. Despite a surgeon's history of advanced laparoscopic experience, there is a definite learning curve associated with the laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band."
"3";"The Authors reporting their experience, discuss some concepts about physiologic evolution of male and female breast. They distinguish between real and false gynaecomastia; stressing the causes of abnormal development of male breast and morphopathological characteristics of gynaecomastia. Careful diagnostic protocol is necessary for a therapeutic approach based on traditional surgery or liposuction: it depends on prevalence of glandular or adipose breast's tissue."
"3";"A 35-year-old female who had previously undergone an open gastric bypass, underwent elective caesarian section and ventral hernia repair, complicated by a double closed-loop obstruction with resulting gastric perforation. Back pain and anemetic nausea predominated, as proximal bowel and pancreatobiliary obstruction followed an afferent limb volvulus. Pancreatitis, cholangitis, and gastric perforation ensued, leading to intraabdominal sepsis. This rare situation must be recognized as a potentially serious complication of gastric bypass surgery, and requires prompt recognition and aggressive surgical correction."
"3";"Vomiting and extreme weight loss may be life-threatening when stenosis develops following vertical banded gastroplasty. Often patients must undergo revisional surgery. Once the stenosis is relieved, the majority of patients will proceed to gain weight at an excessive rate. Placement of an adjustable band during revisional surgery allows us to treat the stenosis while limiting the patients' weight gain and preventing the return of morbid obesity. Performing this operation laparoscopically reduces patient morbidity. 23 patients (16 female, 7 male) were referred because of severe food intolerance following silastic ring or Dacron mesh vertical gastroplasty. The patients were on average 1.75 years after the initial operation (range: 9 months - 6 years). All patients required repeat hospitalizations due to excessive vomiting and dehydration. All patients underwent laparoscopic surgery, with placement of an adjustable band in 21 patients. All operations were performed laparoscopically without need for conversion to laparotomy. There were no intra-operative complications, and all patients were discharged within 24 hours. Patients have been followed for a mean of 7 months (range 3 months to 16 months). All patients became food tolerant without vomiting. 15 patients required inflation of the adjustable band in order to control excessive weight gain. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding at the time of revisional surgery for stenosis appears to be a safe and effective operation that does not add morbidity to surgery, but does prevent the need for further revisional surgeries when patients begin to gain excessive weight after relief of their obstruction."
"3";"Laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) is a well-established procedure for the surgical management of morbid obesity. Most surgeons create the gastroenteral anastomosis by using the circular EEA stapler. We describe an alternative laparoscopic anastomotic technique using the EndoGIA linear stapling device. The stomach was proximally transected with a linear stapler (45 mm, Endo-GIA) to create a 15 to 20 ml pouch. Next, an antecolic Roux-en-Y gastroenterostomy was performed, using the 45 mm Endo-GIA. The proximal loop of the intestine was then separated from the anastomotic site by the Endo-GIA. Finally, the Endo-GIA was used for the intraabdominal creation of a side-to-side enteroenterostomy. Between June and August 2001, 5 patients with mean BMI 56.7 kg/m(2)+/-7.3 underwent LGBP. All patients were seen 6 months post-surgery. Operating time was 7.5 and 6.5 hours for the first 2 operations, but was under 4.5 h for the next 3 cases. 1 patient suffered from perioperative hypoxia leading to long-term artificial respiration. 6 weeks after surgery, 1 patient developed obstruction due to torsion of the enteroenterostomy and required open revision. The 3 remaining patients made an uneventful recovery. All patients lost considerable weight (mean 36.5 kg; [range 32 to 45] after 6 months). No stenosis or anastomotic leakage was noted. A linear stapled anastomosis is an alternative to the use of the circular stapler."
"3";"Lymphedema typically occurs on the extremities and affects millions of people throughout the world. Although currently there is no single treatment proven effective for lymphedema in every patient, suction-assisted lipectomy has been shown to be effective in some patients. Suction-assisted lipectomy offers patients with lower-extremity lymphedema a less invasive, less morbid surgical option compared with traditional excisional techniques. In this article we present a case of lymphedema reduction with suction-assisted lipectomy in a patient with bilateral lower-extremity lymphedema."
"3";"Traditionally, dermatologic surgeons have referred women seeking breast reduction to plastic surgeons for excisional mammoplasty. However, with recent advances in small cannula tumescent liposuction surgery, referral for such surgery may be unnecessary in some cases. Breast liposuction can reduce the size of female breasts that have essentially normal architecture with a minimum of visible scarring and an aesthetically pleasing result. We describe a method for liposuction reduction of female breasts that is safe, efficacious, and associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. Liposuction for breast reduction in women is an appropriate addition to the array of liposuction procedures available to the dermatologic surgeon."
"3";"Since the 1991 NIH consensus conference, obesity surgery has been increasingly accepted as a form of therapy for morbid obesity. Approximately 40% of Veteran patients are obese and would potentially benefit from the operations. Records were reviewed for all obesity operations performed at the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Health Care System between January 1997 and April 2002. Morbidity, mortality, weight loss, and extent of follow-up were the outcomes measures assessed. Forty-six [11 Female (24%), 35 Male (76%)] patients underwent Roux-Y gastric bypass during the 63-month period we reviewed. There was one death from pulmonary hypertension unexpectedly encountered in the operating room. There was a single major complication: an anastomotic leak successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. The Computerized Patient Record System contained extensive weight loss information, with dozens of weight measurements for these patients before and after surgery. Weight loss was sustained in all but 2 patients during the follow-up period. The only patients lost to follow-up were those referred from medical centers outside the boundaries of our integrated health care system. (1) The VA population has the opposite male/female ratio of populations reported in most weight loss studies. Because the health risks attributable to obesity are greater in males, the VA represents an important population to study that may benefit significantly from weight loss surgery. (2) Extensive clinical information available in the computerized medical record combined with frequent accession of health care resources by our patients resulted in a database rich in follow-up data for a population where long-term outcomes are traditionally difficult to obtain. (3) There was very low surgical morbidity and mortality in a high-risk population. This contrasts with the results of most volume-outcome studies and occurred in a low-volume hospital by a high-volume surgical and medical team. (4) Distinct patterns of weight loss were observed."
"3";"It is common belief that sweet eaters will do poorly after gastric restrictive surgery. There is scant evidence for this and significant evidence that sweet eating behavior is not predictive of weight outcome. Preoperative and current sweet eating behavior was assessed in subjects who have had Lap-Band surgery, to find if this influenced weight outcomes. 200 unselected patients who had bands inserted for > 1 year completed a questionaire regarding preoperative sweet eating behavior. The last 100 patients also reported current sweet eating behavior. Sweet eating was scored using a standard dietary questionnaire. Mean +/- SD % excess weight loss at 1 year (% EWL1) for the 100 with the highest preoperative sweet eating scores (SES) was 47.1 +/- 16% compared with a loss of 48.2 +/- 16% by those with the lowest SES (P = 0.64). Analysis showed no significant linear or non-linear correlation between the SES and the % EWL. For the highest quintile of SES, the EWL1 was 47.3 +/- 14% and for the lowest was 46.1 +/- 16% (NS). Sweet eaters were younger (r = -0.21, P = 0.003) and had higher fasting insulin concentrations (r = -0.18, P = 0.03). Preoperative SES had no influence on % EWL1 after controlling for factors known to influence weight loss. % EWL at 2 years (n = 130) and 3 years (n = 88) were not different for sweet eaters and non-sweet eaters. Current sweet eating tendency (n = 100) also had no impact on % EWL. Sweet eaters do not have less favorable weight outcomes following Lap-Band surgery. Our study confirms the findings of two other major studies. Sweet eating behavior should not be used as a preoperative selection criterion for bariatric surgery."
"3";"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of operative experience on perioperative outcomes for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LGB). Between July 1997 and September 2001, 750 patients underwent LGB for the treatment of morbid obesity at our center. We evaluated the perioperative outcomes of the first 150 consecutive patients to determine if a learning curve effect could be demonstrated. The patients were divided into three groups (1, 2, and 3) of 50 consecutive patients, and outcomes for each group were compared. The patients in group 3 had a larger body mass index (BMI), were more likely to have had prior abdominal surgery, and were more likely to have secondary operations at the time of LGB. Operating time decreased from a mean of 311 min in group 11 to 237 min in group 3, and technical complications were reduced by 50% after an experience of 100 cases. Operative time and technically related complications decreased with operative experience even though heavier patients and higher-risk patients were more predominant in the latter part of our experience. LGB is a technically challenging operation with a long learning curve. To minimize morbidity related to the learning curve, strategies for developing training programs must address these challenges."
"3";"There are now a variety of methods to assess body fat distribution, anthropometric (waist circumference and waist/hip W/H ratio), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) measurements, with CT considered as the reference method. Bariatric surgery leads to a significant and usually durable weight loss in morbidly obese patients; when assessing its results, it is of interest to measure changes of total fat tissue and of body fat distribution. In this study, we compared anthropometric, US, and CT measurements of body fat distribution under basal conditions and 1 year after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB); 120 morbidly obese patients were considered at baseline, and 40 patients were re-evaluated 1 year after LAGB. Thickness of visceral and subcutaneous fat measured through CT and US methods was superimposable both under basal conditions and 1 year after LAGB, and the highest correlation was found between CT and US data on visceral fat, followed by CT and US data on subcutaneous fat; a fair correlation was also found between CT and US data on visceral fat and waist circumference. We suggest that evaluation of body fat distribution is accomplished by US instead of CT measurement, because of its lower cost and low exposure risk. Waist circumference stands as a reasonable surrogate of both methods, while W/H ratio is poorly correlated with other measures of body fat distribution."
"3";"The relation between gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and obesity is controversial. The laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) procedure is effective for morbid obesity. Its indication in the presence of GERD, however, is still debated. This study aimed to investigate esophageal symptoms, motility patterns, and acid exposure in morbidly obese patients before and after LAGB placement. For this study, 43 consecutive obese patients were investigated by a standardized symptoms questionnaire, stationary manometry and 24-h ambulatory pH-metry, and 16 patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure were reevaluated 18 months after LAGB placement. Symptom scores and abnormal esophageal acid exposure were found to be significantly higher, Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LOS) pressure was significantly lower in obese patients than in control subjects. After LAGB, esophageal acid exposure was significantly reduced in all but two patients, who presented with proximal of gastric pouch dilation. There is a high prevalence of GERD in the obese population. Uncomplicated LAGB placement reduces the amount of acid in these patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure."
"3";"To study patterns of failure following primary antireflux surgery and to evaluate efficacy of reoperation using a left thoracoabdominal Collis gastroplasty and selective fundoplication. Thirty-one patients who underwent reoperative antireflux surgery between 1991 and 2000 were studied. Transabdominal fundoplication had been performed in 21 patients, and ten patients had a partial fundoplication by left thoracotomy, 1-33 years (mean, 15 years) previously. All patients presented with clinically disabling symptoms. Objective studies documented for all patients, a disrupted fundoplication, a short esophagus, and an associated hiatus hernia (Type I: 21 patients, 68%; Type III: ten patients, 32%), esophagitis (nine patients, 29%), and Barrett's mucosa (five patients, 16%). Abnormal esophageal motility was found in nine of 26 (36%) patients studied. All patients were reoperated using a left thoracoabdominal approach, with epidural analgesia. A Collis gastroplasty was used to lengthen the esophagus, incorporating a complete (24 patients, 77%) or partial (seven patients, 23%) fundoplication based of preoperative esophageal function studies. There was no perioperative mortality. Median length of hospitalization was 8 days, and was uncomplicated for 18 (58%) patients. Postoperative morbidity was considered minimal, and comprised left lower lobe infiltrates (six patients, 19%), atrial fibrillation (three patients, 10%), urinary tract infection (one patient, 3%), superficial wound infection (one patient, 3%), aspiration (one patient, 3%), and nausea (one patient, 3%). Median follow-up was 42 months (6-105 months), and was complete for 29 patients. Six patients (21%) had moderate-severe post-thoracotomy pain, for up to 18 months postoperatively, and five patients (17%) required esophageal dilation, ranging from two to six dilations within the first 6 months after surgery. Overall, 93% (27/29) of patients were satisfied with the results of surgery, in terms of quality of swallowing and control of preoperative symptoms. In this series, failure of primary antireflux surgery was related to short esophagus. Intermediate-term subjective results of reoperative antireflux surgery were good for selected patients who undergo esophageal lengthening and fundoplication. The left thoracoabdominal approach was safe, generally well tolerated, and provided excellent exposure of the esophagogastric junction for complex reoperative antireflux surgery."
"3";"Surgical intervention is currently indicated for patients with BMI > 40 or > 35 with life-threatening comorbidities. Patients with BMI 32-40 without these comorbidities not only have the increased propensity to develop them but also suffer from similar psychosocioeconomic consequences. These patients may not respond to non-surgical treatment of obesity any better than those with BMI > 40. The question has been raised whether to offer them surgical intervention. A study was carried out to determine outcome of surgery on patients with BMI > 32 but < 40 without life-threatening comorbidities but with either psychological, economic or social impairments affecting their quality of life. The approval of our Hospital Internal Review Board was obtained. In addition to routine evaluation for surgical intervention, these patients were required to have the approval of their primary care physician, be seen pre-operatively by a psychiatrist, and have a member of the family or a very close friend present at the time of discussion of operative risks and follow-up requirements. Patients committed to at least a 5-year follow-up. They were to be self-paying patients. The transected silastic ring vertical gastric bypass with a temporary gastrostomy was used. 50 patients, 49 women and one man, were entered into the study between May 1, 1999 and April 30, 2000. 50% were self-pay, and the other 50% were able to obtain coverage through their insurance companies. There were few peri-operative complications and no deaths. The late complications include incisional hernias, dumping and transient alopecia. Hospital stay averaged 3.7 days. Follow-up has been 18-27 months. Weight loss has been excellent. Preliminary results of surgical intervention extended to patients with BMI 32-40 without life-threatening comorbidities but with psychosocioeconomic ramifications are very promising. Long term follow-up and comparison with other bariatric patients are planned."
"3";"This report represents the first known case of a gastric schwannoma in a patient subsequent to a gastric stapling and partitioning procedure for morbid obesity. The submucosal tumor found in the collapsed distal portion of the stomach was merely an incidental finding and it appeared that all of the patient's ongoing symptomatology (nausea and vomiting after meals) was a reflection of the chronic obstruction that was present at the gastric partitioning staple-line. No correlation between gastric stapling and partitioning and the development of gastric schwannoma is known or is suggested in this report."
"3";"In view of concomitant illnesses and sequelae associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality, obesity is considered a major pathological condition. The aim of treatment must be the lasting reduction of overweight. The prerequisite for this is a fundamental change in the patient's inappropriate eating habits, as also other lifestyle aspects. This requires comprehensive and long-term disciplinary management. Within this framework, surgical treatment, in particular the laparoscopic placement of an adjustable gastric band, is the most effective form of achieving weight reduction. The band delays passage of food, and causes early distension of the stomach wall, thus inducing a sensation of satiety. To ensure therapeutic success, nutritional and surgical counseling of the patient has a major role to play."
"1";"The feasibility of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Lap-RYGBP) for morbid obesity is well documented. In a prospective randomized trial, we compared laparoscopic and open surgery. 51 patients (48 females, mean (+/- SD) age 36 +/- 9 years and BMI 42 +/- 4 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to either laparoscopy (n = 30) or open surgery (n = 21). All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year. In the laparoscopy group, 7 patients (23%) were converted to open surgery due to various procedural difficulties. In an analysis, with the converted patients excluded, the morphine doses used postoperatively were significantly (p < 0.005) lower in the laparoscopic group compared to the open group. Likewise, postoperative hospital stay was shorter (4 vs 6 days, p < 0.025). Six patients in the laparoscopy group had to be re-operated due to Roux-limb obstruction in the mesocolic tunnel within 5 weeks. The weight loss expressed in decrease in mean BMI units after 1 year was 14 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 3 after laparoscopy and open surgery, respectively (not significant). Both laparoscopic and open RYGBP are effective and well received surgical procedures in morbid obesity. Reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and shorter sick-leave are obvious benefits of laparoscopy but conversions and/or reoperations in 1/4 of the patients indicate that Lap-RYGBP at present must be considered an investigational procedure."
"2";"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is still a major cause of mortality in developed countries, and dyslipidemia is one of its major causes. In an attempt to reduce both mortality and morbidity from CAD, several dietary, pharmacological, and surgical approaches have been used to reduce plasma cholesterol levels. In this brief review, we summarize the evidence for cholesterol-lowering effects and safety of partial ileal bypass (PIB) procedure in both human and animal studies. The results of the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH), which involved a total of 838 subjects with myocardial infarction, are promising. A 5-year follow-up of this study revealed significant reductions of up to 27% in total cholesterol (TC) and up to 42% in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels along with an increase of up to 8% in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels as compared to controls. These changes were associated with other benefits such as increased HDL/TC and HDL/LDL ratios, and a significant decrease in apolipoprotein (apo) B100 and increase in apo AI levels. Similar results were also demonstrated by other studies. PIB surgery is one of the most effective methods for reduction of plasma cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This procedure is also applicable to treatment of sitosterolemia, a rare genetic disorder in which the absorption of plant sterols is abnormally high. Although no major complications of this method have been reported, more extensive studies are required to evaluate its long-term effects on renal and hepatic function. Similarly, long-term impact of this procedure on progression/regression of atherosclerotic lesions must be documented. Finally, indications for this procedure should be carefully considered, particularly in view of availability of other treatments of dyslipidemia."
"2";"Ultrasound-assisted lipoplasty (UAL) has been associated with particular types of complications and uncertain long-term effects arising from interactions between ultrasonic energy and living tissue. The present review seeks to address these issues. Search strategy Three search strategies were devised to retrieve literature from Medline, Current Contents, Embase and Cochrane Library databases up until April 2000. Study selection Inclusion of papers was largely determined using a predetermined protocol. English language papers were selected. Acceptable study designs included randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, case series or case reports. Data collection and analysis Thirty-six papers met the inclusion criteria. They were tabulated and critically appraised in terms of methodology and design, outcomes, and the possible influence of bias, confounding and chance. Other papers were also included to provide background material. There was little high-level evidence available comparing UAL and suction-assisted lipoplasty (SAL), with no conclusive evidence that UAL has a safety benefit, although low-quality evidence suggests that UAL is associated with reduced surgeon fatigue as well as increased operating times, slower aspiration rates and an increased learning curve. There is inadequate evidence to determine whether the theoretical potential for DNA damage from ultrasound is realized in the clinical setting. The evidence base for UAL is inadequate to determine the procedure's safety and efficacy. The potential for DNA damage must be investigated with appropriate in vivo animal models. Recommendations for the safe use of UAL are discussed."
"3";"The treatment of gigantic gynecomastia has usually been accompanied by ugly scars. Because of our experiences in 38 patients with gynecomastia grade III, we suggest a surgical technique that not only involves a simple mastectomy and liposuction, but also a mere periareoler incision and, if necessary, repeated focusplasty and liposuction. Excessive skin can be repaired with a so-called focusplasty. In young patients this can successfully be achieved in one operation. Because skin has a minimized ability to retract in older patients, repeat operative sessions are necessary."
"3";"Surgical decompresssion of the orbit may be considered as a suitable form of therapy if, as a result of the increased volume inside the orbit, there are motility disorders such as diplopia or a progressive decrease in visual acuity. In view of the fact that this operation will not cure the underlying disease, the treatment should be as mild as possible. In five subjects with Graves' orbitopathy we managed to extend the volume of the intraconal orbit by microsurgical liposuction. We carried out a lateral canthotomy to approach the orbit behind the globe. After decompression of the soft tissue, the lateral palpebral ligaments were refixed. To assess the scale of the functional rehabilitation we compared preoperative parameters (visual acuity, Hertel's index, visual field, motility) with the postoperative results. In all cases we found a significant improvement of position and motility without signs of diplopia. There was a postoperative increase in the visual field and visual acuity was 0.4 and the protusion of the globe could be decreased by 3-6 mm (Hertel's index). Furthermore, the ocular hypertension we found preoperatively could no longer be detected after the operation. Microsurgical decompression of the soft tissue via an approach from behind the globe proved to be a very gentle alternative to conventional methods of orbital decompression because of the satisfying functional and esthetic rehabilitation in selected cases."
"3";"This study presents the authors' experience with gluteus augmentation with autologus fat grafts and liposuction methods, having recorded the evolution of gluteus reshaping with autologus intramuscular fat graft injections for the past 5 years. Preoperative shape is discussed and patient evaluations, operative techniques, postoperative management, and longterm results are emphasized."
"3";"Ischemic optic neuropathy occurred in a patient following liposuction. Perioperative anemia and hypotension may be the cause of this complication. Correction of anemia with transfusion improved the hemoglobin and hematocrit but the right eye remained blind. Liposuction should be added to the list of the surgical procedures that may produce ischemic optic neuropathy as an isolated complication."
"3";"Gastric bypass may be facilitated by a stapled gastrojejunostomy. This study compared two different techniques for performing this critical anastomosis in open surgery. 67 consecutive patients were retrospectively studied for weight loss, hospital length of stay, anastomotic stricture, wound complication, and incisional hernia. 49 patients had a two layer hand-sutured gastrojejunostomy over a 34 Fr bougie via a laparotomy (sutured). 18 patients had a stapled gastrojejunostomy using the technique of Wittgrove and Clark via a laparotomy (stapled). All patients received prophylactic intravenous antibiotics preoperatively. Initial BMI, % of excess weight lost at 6 weeks and 6 months, and hospital length of stay were not statistically different between the groups. However, the rate of wound complication and incisional hernia rate were significantly higher in the stapled group when compared to the sutured group (p< 0.01). Based on these data we suggest that the technique of Wittgrove and Clark for performing the gastrojejunostomy should not be used in open gastric bypass as it results in increased rates of wound complication and incisional hernia."
"3";"The authors determined prospectively the safety of continuous spinal anesthesia combined with general anesthesia and the efficacy of postoperative pain relief with continuous spinal analgesia for morbidly obese patients undergoing vertical banded gastroplasty. 27 patients (13 men, 14 women) with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.4 +/- 7.8 and several co-morbidities were studied. All patients were anesthetized with the same anesthetic regimen, which included midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, muscle relaxants, nitrous oxide, isoflurane and intrathecal bupivacaine. Postoperative pain relief was provided for 5 days and all patients received the same regimen, which included intrathecal bupivacaine, fentanyl and intravenous tenoxicam. The intrathecal analgesic regimen was administered continuously through a pump which had the facility of providing bolus doses when requested in predetermined lockout intervals. Intra-operative monitoring included hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. Additional postoperative monitoring included respiratory rate, degree of sedation, sensory level of anesthesia, motor response and intensity of pain. Intraoperative anesthetic technique was safe and provided satisfactory results in the immediate postoperative period. Furthermore, the postoperative analgesia regimen provided effective analgesia in all patients. The mean doses of fentanyl and bupivacaine infused intrathecally for the first 24 postoperative hours were 14.1 +/- 2.0 microg.h(1) and 0.7 +/- 0.1 mg.h(1) respectively, while the requirements of analgesia decreased progressively with time. The technique provided effective analgesia with low pain scores, which was reflected by ease in mobilizing and performing physical exercises with the physiotherapist. Only minor complications related to anesthesia and analgesia were encountered. To our knowledge, this technique of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia has not been described before in morbidly obese patients. This regimen merits further controlled trials to establish its place in the perioperative management of morbidly obese patients."
"3";"As the number of laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGBs) placed has increased, the number of patients requiring removal of the device has also increased. The data from our institution, a U.S. university medical center, were reviewed to determine the feasibility, patient characteristics, and early results of converting patients from LAGB to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A total of 350 patients underwent LAGB placement at our institution from 2001 to 2008. Of these, 26 required conversion to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the following reasons: slippage, poor weight loss, LAGB intolerance, esophageal dilation, infection, and gastric ischemia. All conversions were completed laparoscopically. The average operating time and length of stay was 160 minutes and 3 days, respectively. Three complications developed. The average interval to conversion was 29 months. The average follow-up after conversion was 18 months. The average percentage of excess body weight loss at conversion was 23%. At 12 months after conversion, the patients had achieved an average percentage of excess body weight loss of 56% from their pre-LAGB weight. The increasing popularity of the LAGB has led to a considerable number of revisions of the device. Our early experience has shown that converting patients from LAGB to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is feasible and safe and can offer patients substantial additional weight loss."
"3";"Anastomotic failure remains to be one of the main problems in esophageal surgery with leakage rates up to 30% being reported currently. We addressed that problem by modifying the gastric-tube formation in utilizing all of the gastric fundus and omitting the resection of the lesser gastric curvature and accompanying vessels. Experimentally, those fundus-rotation gastroplasties were significantly longer and better perfused than conventional gastroplasties. In a clinical series of 53 patients (45 male, eight female, range 42-83 years) undergoing esophageal resection (49 malignancies, four non-malignant esophageal disease), four anastomotic leakages were found (7.5%). Three patients died due to a bronchial leak and adult respiratory distress syndrome, one with a complete gastric-tube necrosis and one with a colon perforation, sepsis and multiorgan failure. Eight patients developed a significant anastomotic stricture requiring repeated endoscopic dilatations. From our experimental and clinical experience, we conclude that the favorable length and perfusion of fundus-rotation gastroplasties allow for safe anastomosis at either the cervical or thoracic level."
"3";"To characterize features of internal hernia (IH) at small-bowel follow-through (SBFT) following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure (RYGBP) for morbid obesity. The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study; informed consent was waived. Radiologic database review revealed 1655 SBFT studies over 6 years in 1282 patients after RYGBP. IH was suggested on 24 studies in 23 patients. Studies were analyzed for atypical bowel configuration, change in bowel or suture position, and obstruction. Chart review was performed to determine clinical course, treatment, and outcome. Studies from a control group of 21 RYGBP patients were similarly analyzed. Statistical comparison was performed with the Fisher exact test. Clinical and/or surgical evidence of IH was found following 21 SBFT studies in 20 of 1282 patients (1.6%). Atypical bowel configuration with clustered small bowel was identified on all studies. Cluster location was lateral to descending colon (n = 10), left upper quadrant (n = 6), left upper and mid abdomen (n = 3), right midabdomen (n = 2), under the gastric pouch (n = 1), and right lower quadrant (n = 1). For two studies, two locations of clustered bowel were identified. Change in jejunojejunal suture position occurred in all cases with radiopaque suture (n = 15). Other signs of IH included displaced colon (n = 19), visible entrance and exit limbs into the hernia (n = 17), stasis in clustered bowel (n = 16), densely matted bowel (n = 12), and a straight left lateral border of clustered bowel (n = 10). Partial obstruction occurred in 16 patients. Findings of atypical bowel configuration, clustered bowel, and staple line change were significant when compared with the control. IH following RYGBP is a rare but potentially fatal complication. Radiologists must be aware of this complication and its diagnostic features at SBFT."
"2";"The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in the recent decades, and obesity is now a major public health problem. Obesity negatively influences an individual's health by increasing mortality and raising the risk for multiple medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. In addition, the obese individual is often the brunt of social discrimination. Weight loss has been shown to reduce the risk for many of these comorbid conditions. A multifaceted approach to the obese patient should include identifying potential causes for weight gain, outlining medical conditions that would benefit by weight loss, and tailoring a weight loss program that is safe and effective for the individual. Components of a successful weight loss program include dietary intervention, recommendations for physical activity, behavior modification, and, in a select group of patients, pharmacologic or surgical intervention."
"3";"Adjustable silicone gastric banding (ASGB) has been advocated as a minimally invasive procedure that is completely reversible for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity. Band erosion (BE) is one of the possible complications of ASGB. The authors report their experience with BE and discuss its possible causes. Between February 1993 and February 1998, the authors performed 122 ASGB: 51 open and 71 laparoscopic procedures. Two cases of BE occurred (1.6%). Band erosion is a possible complication of ASGB that is often not diagnosed immediately. Prevention is essential and consists primarily in correct placement of the band. There appears to be only one solution to BE: removal of the band. Placement of a new band after removal is possible; the minimum interval is not known."
"3";"In 1991, we started to use a new surgical technique for breast reduction with a single vertical scar incision as developed by Marchac, Lassus, and Lejour. The operative procedure wsa changed step-by-step according to the following significant modifications: Simultaneous liposuction is carried out only in the presence of extensive axillary fatty tissue. The undermining of the glandular tissue is limited to the extension of glandular resection. The number of glandular sutures is significantly reduced. A central fixating suture to the pectoral fascia is performed only in the presence of extreme ptosis. The positioning of the nipple-areola complex represents the final step of the reduction procedure after the resection of the glandular tissue. Based on our experience with more than 800 breast reductions, this technique is considered to be a safe standard procedure for nearly all breast sizes."
"2";"Liposuction is a frequently applied technique in aesthetic plastic surgery, with which subcutaneous adipose tissue can be removed. In recent decades new techniques of liposuction were developed. This led to better results and fewer complications. Liposuction is indicated as symptomatic treatment of obesity and (or) lipomas. Liposuction is not without risks; patients have to be informed of practical consequences and possible complications of the technique."
"3";"The aim of the study was the analysis of chosen nutritional habits and physical activity among patients qualified for bariatric surgery. The research was conducted by questionnaire method. The results of the study show that number and regularity of meals was improper. Everybody snack, eg. sweets. About 50% of researched read information on the food packages, but only few participants paid attention to the nutritional and energy value of food products. TV and radio were the main source of nutritional information. Nutritional behaviors men and women were different. The level of physical activity was low."
"3";"In the treatment of morbid obesity, surgery had been the only method of obtaining a good and enduring weight loss. Although the procedure of choice is still a matter of debate, among gastric restriction procedures LAP-BAND has become our first choice. We report the results from 62 morbidly obese patients operated in the period October 1994-December 1996. Their characteristics were: mean age 35.6 years, mean body weight 130.6 kg, mean height 162.3 cm, mean body mass index (BMI) 49.9 kg/m2, mean percentage ideal body weight (%IBW) 215.7 and mean excess weight (EW) 69.57 kg. Twenty-four months after surgery we found a mean BMI of 39.3, a mean %IBW of 168.6 and a mean % EW loss of 88.5. We removed the band in two patients: one after 9 months because of stoma stenosis and pouch enlargement in a woman who had been lost at follow-up, and the other for gastric slippage occurring after 18 months due to incorrect fixation of the band. Our results led us to consider LAP-BAND as the surgical approach for severe obesity among those patients selected for gastric restriction; indeed, it was very safe as well as effective and was rarely followed by complications."
"3";"The results of nonadjustable gastric banding (NAGB) and stoma adjustable gastric banding (SAGB) in the treatment of morbid obesity are compared. Of 300 patients operated laparoscopically with NAGB since 1993 and of 25 with SAGB since 1994, 65 in the NAGB and 11 in the SAGB group were available for a 3-year follow-up study. For assessment of the outcome of our laparoscopic approach in terms of weight loss, length of hospitalization, immediate and late postoperative wound complications, postoperative changes in the band and pouch area, were compared in patients from both groups. The patient's opinion on the outcome of the operation and the quality of postoperative digestion was recorded. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay and wound complication rate in the two groups or the weight loss at 36 months after surgery. There was a statistically significant lower incidence of postoperative food intolerance and vomiting and a lower rate of immediate and long-term reoperation rate in the SAGB group. SAGB is a method with less postoperative complications in food intolerance and vomiting in comparison with NAGB."
"3";"Although jejunoileal bypass results in end-stage liver disease in up to 100% of patients, little is known about outcome after liver transplantation. The clinical courses of six patients who underwent liver transplantation at UCLA for decompensated cirrhosis owing to a jejunoileal bypass were reviewed. Liver function, allograft pathology, renal function, and nutritional status were assessed. Of the four patients with an intact jejunoileal bypass, two of the three who were biopsied had recurrent steatotic liver disease. The two patients whose jejunoileal bypass was reversed at the time of liver transplantation had lower alkaline phosphatase, lower creatinine, higher albumin, and higher cholesterol, and were more obese than their counterparts with intact bypasses. Patients undergoing liver transplantation for jejunoileal bypass-associated liver disease should, if possible, have their bypass reversed at the time of transplantation; otherwise, they must be followed closely and be biopsied routinely. Recurrent liver disease should prompt reversal of the jejunoileal bypass."
"3";"The development of blunt liposuction by Illouz [1] in 1978 ushered in a new era in body sculpting. For the first time it had become possible to dependably remove large amounts of subcutaneous fat and decrease saddlebags and bulges to provide a smoother contour. Refinements in liposuction techniques have made it possible to dramatically resculpt the subsurface plane and improve body contour virtually from head to toe -2-4-. Mark Gilliland first performed abdominal etching by removing specific grooves of subcutaneous fat to accentuate the appearance of the abdominal musculature [5-8]. We have developed a new cannula for precision etching. This technique has been used in 25 patients with good results and has resulted in only one complication, which was the result of placing one of the horizontal etching lines at the level of the umbilicus. This created an unseemly fold that is best avoided."
"3";"In earlier studies of vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), staple-line disruptions (SD) were only reported in a few per cent or less. Two recent studies have shown a significantly higher frequency of SD. To find the true frequency of SD, all patients must be examined regardless of weight outcome. 91 consecutive patients were examined by a standardized radiological method at different postoperative intervals ranging from 6 to 48 months. 41 out of 91 patients developed SD. The average diameter of the disruptions was 6 mm (range 2-16 mm). During the first 2 years of follow-up, when at least 31% of the patients had developed SD, there was no significant difference in weight loss between the group with SD and the group without SD. SD is an inherent problem of VBG which has been underestimated for a long period of time. An SD frequency of 45% or more within the first few years is not acceptable and changes in the VBG technique must be considered."
"3";"Anastomotic and staple line leaks (ASL) occur after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) with a reported incidence as high as 6%. Leaks are the second most common cause of post-LRYGB mortality after pulmonary embolism, and can be associated with significant morbidity. Prevention and early detection may limit both morbidity and mortality. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed on all LRYGBs performed in a community hospital by a single surgeon from August 2001 to December 2005. All operations were performed using a linear-stapled anastomosis with buttressing material, handsewn otomy closures, stay sutures, intraoperative leak testing, and fibrin sealant. 760 patients underwent LRYGB during the study period. Eighty-nine percent (n = 674) were female and 11% (n = 86) were male. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 50 kg/m2 (range 36-83 kg/m2). Mean age was 40 years (range 17-72 years). Two patients developed three gastric pouch staple line leaks (0.4%). There were no mortalities. Operative technique, including appropriate staple sizing, staple line reinforcement, handsewn otomy closures, placement of stay sutures, intraoperative leak testing, and placement of fibrin sealant contributed to a lower than expected incidence of ASL after LRYGB in this series."
"3";"This paper discusses the basic concepts of the aesthetics of all kneecap areas looking for the proportions and comprehensive treatment by means of liposuction. I detected and described an anatomic trait that I find frequently among my clinical cases, which is that of there being a certain amount of unsightly adipose tissue along the medial region extending from the widest portion of the knee down to the protrusion of the calf muscles (gastrocnemius) and extending to the crest of the tibia. This is adipose tissue, which, when found, deforms the normal leg to a great extent, shaping it into a sort of straight column. This paper discusses ways to avoid any damage to the osteoarticular structures when liposuction is done in the kneecap area. Liposuction of the knee area is a simple but laborious technique. It is essential to be highly familiar with the anatomy of the knee and constantly bear in mind the aesthetic appearance being sought. This must be proportioned to the lower limb, since the correction of one area usually leads to a lack of balance in contour of the lower limbs."
"3";"A review was done of the records of 50 patients who had osseous genioplasty performed at the same sitting as face lifting and, in many cases, submental lipectomy over a 20-year period by the senior author. The types of genioplasties were sliding advancement (40), lengthening with interpositional bone graft (7), and reduction (3). In 9 patients, chin implants were removed, generally because of inadequate chin projection or implant erosion. Three patients were operated on under local anesthesia, the remainder under general anesthesia. Associated procedures, done in 46 patients, included rhinoplasty, forehead lifting, blepharoplasty, lateral canthopexy, excision of buccal fat pads, reduction mammaplasty, and abdominoplasty. In 4 patients, associated maxillofacial procedures were performed, including Le Fort I and III osteotomies, two-jaw surgery, mandibular advancement with sagittal splitting, and orbital expansion. The perceived advantages of osseous genioplasty were greater versatility in dealing with problems in other than the sagittal plane, the possibility of greater chin projection, and a tightening of the submental musculature. Complications occurred in 10 patients. These included two hematomas requiring aspiration in the office, a prolapsed submandibular gland requiring later excision, a transient weakness of the marginal mandibular nerve, a transient numbness of the lower lip on one side, four revisions of scars resulting from the face lifting, and one localized wound infection in the parasymphyseal area that resolved with oral antibiotics. The most common complaint, which came from 8 female patients at some time from 1 month to 3 years postoperatively, was that the chin was ""too strong."" In 6 of these patients, most of whom were operated on early in the series, some of the chin projection was reduced by burring. Osseous genioplasty can be performed safely along with face lifting and submental lipectomy. The degree of advancement necessary in aesthetic surgical patients is generally less than that required in reconstructive patients. Patient satisfaction is great unless the chin is overly advanced."
"3";"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine in the patients undergoing liposuction after subcutaneous infiltration of 0.06% lidocaine. It was found that the absorption of lidocaine was slow. The mean peak concentration of lidocaine that was 1.16 ug/mg with a range of 0.67 to 2.84 ug/mg occurred 4-13 hours after lidocaine administration. The peak concentration (Y) was correlated with the dose (X) of lidocaine, which was drawn as Y = -0.494 + 0.071X (r = 0.934, P < 0.001). We concluded that the tumescent technique is an effective and safe method for the patients undergoing liposuction."
"3";"A total of 30 consecutive morbidly obese patients, six males and 24 females, who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) between January 1992 and December 1994 and were followed up by endoscopy and biopsy were included in this study with the aim to determine the short- and mid-term complications and to investigate alterations in esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa after surgery. All patients underwent endoscopy before operation. Postoperatively, 28 patients were reendoscoped at 6 months, 26 at 12 months, and 22 at 18 months. Biopsies were taken from the lower part of esophagus, just below the esophagogastric junction (vertical part of the partitioned stomach), corpus, antrum, and duodenal bulb. Before operation 5 patients (16.6%) had a hiatus hernia and four of them (13.3%) had esophagitis. Endoscopic gastritis was diagnosed in nine patients (30%) and endoscopic duodenitis in two (6. 6%). Histologically, in 15 patients (50%) esophagitis was recognized; in 24 patients (80%) corpus gastritis; in 27 patients (90%) antral gastritis; and in 23 (76.6%) duodenitis. Helicobacter pylori was found in 20 (66.6%) patients. Postoperatively, three patients developed a mild stoma stenosis and were treated only by passing the endoscope 6 months after operation; one patient, with a severe stoma stenosis, was treated by Eder-Puestow dilatations and surgery. Gastric ulcer was found in two patients 6 and 12 months after surgery. One patient developed an endostomach channel because of staple line dehiscence 18 months after VBG. An increasing incidence of esophagitis and gastritis of the vertical part of the stomach was found at 6 and 12 months. Endoscopic and histologic gastritis of the corpus and antrum, as well as endoscopic and histologic duodenitis decreased gradually after surgery. Our findings suggest that postoperative complications of VBG can be diagnosed by endoscopy, and some of them can easily be managed. Vertical banded gastroplasty causes not only no harm to the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa but also influences them favorably."
"3";"An efficient liposuction is one performed behind and above the abdominal superficial fascia. It is followed first by a dissection at the deep side of this fascia, and then after a change of plane, at the supra-umbilical level to reach the pre-muscular fascia plane. Dissection is then adjusted according to the amount of excess skin. As the amount of tissue that needs to be vascularized by the subdermal arterial network is reduced, and as no major lymphatic trunk is cut, the partial subfascial abdominoplasty respects the anatomy of the region better. In our experience (65 cases since March 1989) this quick and reliable technique totally avoids the most frequent risk of abdominoplasty: seroma."
"3";"The article discusses four operations for vertical gastroplasty performed for the first time in Russia at the Research Centre of Surgery, RAMS, for degree IV obesity (the body weight of the patients ranged from 115 to 183 kg). The suturing instruments CEEA-28, TA-90, and CIA-90 manufactured by Auto Suture Instruments, USA, were used. Subsequent examination of patients in follow-up periods of as long as 4 months showed a favorable effect of the operations: body weight reduced, the patient's health and the course of concomitant diseases was milder."
"3";"Elderly patients with burns who were age 70 years or older and who were admitted to Tokyo Medical College Hospital from 1981 to 1992 were evaluated. Among 63 patients with burns, operations were performed in 35. Of the 63, 18 patients died (six after operation). Aggressive surgical wound closure with dermolipectomy, which we have been performing since 1986, obtained statistically significantly earlier wound closure compared with conventional methods. In cases with a burn index of 10 to 30, the number of fatalities was significantly lower. In addition, the lowering of the ability of daily life and mental status after the wound closure was statistically and significantly smaller. From these facts, aggressive wound closure with dermolipectomy appears appropriate for elderly patients with burns."
"3";"Blood loss during liposuction has been a concern when more than 1500 mL of material are removed during one session. Several authors have claimed that blood loss is dramatically reduced when the targeted area is infiltrated with large amounts of dilute lidocaine with epinephrine (""tumescent"" or ""superwet"" technique). Using this technique, 25 consecutive cases in which the liposuction aspirate was expected to be 1000 mL or more were investigated with pre- and postoperative measurements of hemoglobin. In addition, hemoglobin was also measured in the fluid fraction of the aspirate. The mean +/- SD aspirated volume was 1658 +/- 518 mL and the mean +/- SD fall in postoperative hemoglobin was 0.7 +/- 0.6 g/100 mL (5.4% +/- 4.9%). The mean amount of blood per liter of aspirate was calculated to be 10.5 +/- 5.2 mL. These results clearly demonstrate that the blood loss when using the tumescent or superwet technique is dramatically reduced compared with the dry or classical ""wet"" technique."
"3";"Over a 19-month period 25 bilateral reduction mammaplasties were performed using the Lejour technique. Results were assessed retrospectively. The mean follow-up was 12 months. The study showed that minor complications were common (40%), that nipple-areolar sensation was frequently reduced and that minor revision surgery for persistent dog-ears was often necessary (20%). Comparison with complications and revision rates in a similar group of patients who had undergone reduction mammaplasty using an inferior pedicle technique showed remarkably similar results. The positive findings of the current study were that nipple-areola necrosis was not encountered, patient satisfaction was high and the aesthetic results were generally good."
"3";"One of the causes of a depressed naso-jugal groove is the fixation of the septum orbitale at the level of the inferior-medial portion of the arcus marginalis. To permit the leveling of the groove, it is necessary to liberate the subjacent orbital septum from its fixation to the arcus marginalis. To avoid recurrence of the depression, some fat tissue is properly placed in the undermined space subjacent to the groove. This can be done by free fat grafting or fat pad sliding."
"3";"A graphic and written anatomic data sheet (ADS) for facial aesthetic surgery and body contour surgery is presented as a tool for: (1) analyzing surgical maneuvers and their effect on final outcome; (2) recording individual anatomic variations; (3) communicating data between office personnel and colleagues; (4) aiding in the treatment of the postsurgical patient; (5) use as a worksheet for the surgeon; and (6) standardizing, evaluating, and comparing surgical techniques. The ADS takes account of the common aesthetic facial and body contour procedures performed in plastic surgery. A supplemental rubber stamp for use on the office chart, with graphics identical to those of the ADS, identifies areas of treatment concern before and after surgery."
"3";"Madelung's disease is a rare disfiguring lipomatosis of unknown etiology. The only effective therapy is the palliative surgical removal of the fatty tissue by lipectomy or liposuction. Experience with eighteen surgically treated patients shows that despite a high rate of complications and the tendency to recur, both techniques might be very useful."
"3";"The treatment of larger types of gynecomastia is significantly different than that of less severe gynecomastias. Special concerns of the former include areola enlargement, nipple-areola ptosis, and redundant skin. Many procedures have been described to address these issues, none of which is completely satisfactory; these are reviewed here. Unsatisfactory results may be due to residual breast hypertrophy, skin redundancy, complications related to nipple-areola placement, form and viability, and cosmetically unacceptable scars. We describe a new technique that uses an inferior pedicle to reposition the nipple-areola complex and to maintain its neurovascular integrity and form. A superiorly based chest wall flap in conjunction with suction-assisted lipectomy maximizes chest wall contour. There are no breast mound scars, only a periareolar and inframammary scar."
"3";"A complete study of the flank region's unaesthetic distortions is reported. Comments regarding and illustrations of the different clinical appearances of local skin turgor and fat deposits are also noted. A classification of the different types of flank distortions, whether or not combined with similar problems of the surrounding regions, complete the study for the indication of correct treatment. Liposuction, surgery, or both, combined in the same or different stages, complete the main steps of the procedure."
"3";"The authors examined 131 patients with alimentary-constitutional obesity of Degrees III-IV before and after operation for ""small stomach"" formation. All patients underwent pre- and post-operative endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. The level of gastric mucosa oxygenation was measured in 50 patients before and in various periods after surgery. For this purpose the authors suggested an original endoscopic +spectrum analyzer and a method for determining the level of oxygenation of the mucosa of the organ. The level of gastric mucosa oxygenation was significantly lower in patients with obesity than in healthy individuals of the control group. After the operation the oxygenation level increased significantly, which was connected with an altered diet regimen, reduced amount of the ingested food, loss of weight, and improved microcirculation in the mucous membrane of the organs of the alimentary tract. The authors emphasize in particular the absence of blood supply disorders at the site of application of a synthetic fluoronlavsan band (in the region of the anastomosis), which is among the indices of the physiological property of this method for surgical treatment of patients with alimentary-constitutional obesity."
"3";"The results of a questionnaire survey on obesity surgery sent to 970 consultant general surgeons working in the United Kingdom National Health Service are presented. The response rate was 37%. There were 38 surgeons actively practising this surgery. The majority were performing a gastric procedure, mostly gastroplasty, but some did gastric bypass or banding. Three were doing the biliopancreatic bypass. Most surgeons were doing less than 10 operations a year. A total of 109 expressed an interest in attending a UK symposium and 59 would participate in a UK Bariatric Register. This practice, though only a small part of UK surgery, is larger than expected."
"3";"A vertical banded gastroplasty was performed in an adult female patient with Prader-Willi syndrome in an attempt to prevent the metabolic deterioration caused by polyphagia. After her operation, the patient felt satiated with the scheduled amount of food and one month later, her fasting blood sugar concentration (FBS) decreased from 521 to 125 mg/dl, and her urinary sugar excretion (US) from 257 to 9 g/day. Both glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were also improved. However, these parameters subsequently became worse after dietary control was lost since the surgical procedure alone was unable to continue to suppress the insatiable desire to eat food. Both her glucose tolerance and insulin secretion by the 31st postoperative month were better than before the surgery, but worse than at one month after the surgery. At the end of the surgery, but worse than at one month after the surgery. At the end of the 34th postoperative month, even under the temporary administration of 0.625 mg/day of glibenclamide, her FBS was 158 mg/dl and US, 38.1 g/day. Her body weight had also increased to over her preoperative value. Based on these results, we conclude that the effect of gastroplasty to prevent metabolic deterioration in our patient with Prader-Willi syndrome gradually diminishes."
"3";"Body compositional changes during rapid weight loss and after weight stabilization were prospectively studied in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastroplasty operations. Body composition was studied preoperatively and 6 and 24 months postoperatively in 23 patients by use of a total body counter (40K) and an isotope dilution technique. The mean fat mass, cell mass, and intracellular water (ICW) decreased during the first 6 months (p less than 0.001) and remained unchanged at the 24-month test. However, the mean liters of extracellular water (ECW) did not change. Consequently, the ECW/ICW ratio, high in states of malnutrition, rose above postoperative levels. A strong correlation was found between decreases in cell mass and increases in the ECW/ICW ratio."
"3";"Pulmonary function and pulmonary gas exchange at rest, and during and after a standard exercise load of 500 kpm in 1 min on bicycle ergometer were studied in 34 women with severe, uncomplicated obesity, aged 37.8 (20-59) years, before and 1 year after gastric banding, resulting in a weight loss from 113.2 (84-156) to 81.7 (60-110) kg. Following the weight loss, TLC and VC rose from 93 and 94 per cent of expected to 98 and 101 per cent, respectively. FRC, ERV and FRC/TLC rose more markedly from 77, 64 and 83 per cent to 98, 109 and 99 per cent. IC fell from 108 to 99 per cent. RV and RV/TLV remained unchanged. FEV1.0 rose from 97 to 103 per cent, while MVV rose from 102 to 112 per cent, i.e. above normal. TLCO and PaCO2 remained unchanged, at 90 and 95 per cent, whereas PaO2 rose from 86 to 91 per cent. Resting O2 intake (VO2) decreased from 147 to 115 per cent of the expected for normal weight women, while VO2/BSA decreased from 113 to 99 per cent, the changes being greater than expected from commonly used formulas for prediction of metabolic rate. O2 cost of work (EO2) decreased from 142 to 105 per cent. Resting ventilation (V) declined from 136 to 113 per cent, while ventilatory cost of work (EV) decreased from 142 to 105 per cent. CO2 recovery time after work (CO2RT) decreased from 121 to 100 per cent, while the ratios CO2RT to EO2 and to extra CO2 output of work (ECO2) rose slightly. Thus, the loss of weight led to increased filling of the lungs, improved dynamic function, reduced ventilation/perfusion disturbances and greater than expected reduction of energy expenditure, both at rest and exercise. In the obese state there was no evidence of alveolar hypoventilation or impaired ventilatory control. The beneficial effect of weight reduction on the exertional dyspnea included a combination of marked reduction of ventilatory demands and moderate rise in ventilatory capacity."
"3";"The objective of this study was to measure psychosocial functioning in morbid obese patients before and after horizontal gastric banding surgery, and to analyse the relations between the changes in psychosocial functioning and preoperative variables and degree of weight loss. METHODS: One hundred and three patients undergoing horizontal gastric banding surgery from 1982-85 were personally interviewed and rated by the author on DSM-III axis 1, 2 and 5, the CPRS, demographic data and precoded clinical scales. The interviews and ratings were completed in the last week before the operation. In addition the patients completed questionnaires concerning psychic symptoms (SCL-90) and quality of life. Twenty-five patients also completed the questionnaires six months before the operation. The patients were followed up after one and three years. RESULTS: There were 66 women and 24 men with a mean age of 35.4 years. Their mean preoperative weight was 121.8 kg corresponding to a Broca Index of 1.72 and a Body Mass Index of 41.5. They had a mean SCL-90/GSI score of 0.99. Fourty-one percent got a diagnosis on DSM-III axis 1 and 22% a diagnosis on axis 2. Thirty-seven percent had made at least one contact with health services before the operation due to psychiatric problems. There were no strong relations between the relative preoperative weight and any other preoperative variable. The follow-up rate was 93%. The patients had a mean weight loss of 34.9 kg after one year and 31.5 kg three years after the operation. On group level the course and outcome of psychosocial functioning was a beneficial one. These changes were highly statistically significant and evident after one year, with only slight differences to the three years follow-up. The degree of weight loss explained a modest but statistically significant part of the variance in most of the psychosocial outcome variables when the preoperative level of the variable and the preoperative weight were controlled for. The degree of psychiatric contact in the follow-up period seemed to reflect another dimension. It was not related to the changes in the other psychosocial outcome variables, nor to the degree of weight loss, but was highly correlated to the degree of preoperative psychiatric contact. A group of patients with negative psychosocial outcome was identified. This group was characterized by a higher frequency of preoperative psychiatric help-seeking, than the rest of the patients. This pattern was most evident in a subgroup of 19% of the patients, who had a negative psychosocial reaction in spite of a sufficient weight loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"3";"We investigated early and midterm results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as an isolated primary and secondary operation after failed gastric banding. Between May 2004 and October 2007, a total of 70 patients (female 77%, mean age 43 (21-65) years, mean initial body mass index (BMI) 46 (35-61) kg/m(2)) were prospectively evaluated and operated by LSG. In 41 patients, LSG was performed as a primary operation (group 1) and in 29 patients as a secondary procedure after failed gastric banding (group 2). The overall average follow-up time after LSG was 24 (12-53) months; follow-up rate 1 year after operation was 100%, after 2 years 98%, and after 3 years 95%. There were no intraoperative complications, no conversion with shorter operation time in group 1 (91 vs. 132 min, p = 0.001). Early morbidity of LSG was 5% (major) and 7% (minor); mortality was zero. Average excessive BMI loss after 1 year was 65% (9-127%), after 2 years 63% (13-123%), and after 3 years 60% (9-111%). Midterm morbidity was 13%. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding early and midterm morbidity, reoperation rate for complications (11.4%), or insufficient weight loss (7%). LSG is a safe bariatric procedure with good weight loss in the first 3 years postop. It can be used as an isolated initial treatment and as a secondary treatment after failed gastric banding. However, in the absence of long-term results, we suggest LSG to be performed only in controlled trials."
"3";"In recent years autologous fat transplantation employing liposuction has become an established method for correction of small soft tissue defects and irregularities of skin contour. Only a small amount of fat may be used because fat cells will be nourished by perifusion alone until neovascularisation occurs. Transplantation of a large amount of fat will result in fat necrosis. The inappropriate use of fat for breast augmentation after liposuction is described in a case report."
"3";"The body composition of lean control subjects was compared with that of subjects following biliopancreatic diversion for morbid obesity, when their excess weight had been stabilized at under 40 per cent of the ideal body weight value for over two years. Lean body mass, body cell mass and fat were indirectly calculated from total body water and total body sodium, measured by isotope dilution technique. The body composition in the two groups of subjects was essentially normal, as was indicated by the percentage values of the body composition parameters and by the linear correlations between body weight and the lean body compartments size."
"3";"This is the first published report of the use of liposuction for removing fat while intentionally minimizing the resultant appearance change. Ten to 20 gm buttock fat were removed from 31 male volunteers for chemical analysis of dioxins. Unlike conventional techniques of fat biopsy, liposuction allows larger quantities to be removed for study without noticeable scarring or deformity."
"3";"With the aid of the national Medical Birth Registries and Discharge Registries in Denmark and Sweden it was possible to identify and study delivery outcome in 77 women who, prior to pregnancy, had undergone an intestinal bypass operation for obesity. Analysis of birth weight and pregnancy length distribution showed that infants borne by these women had an increased rate of low birth weight, short gestation, and also growth retardation. There were no distinct differences between those infants that were conceived less than 24 months or more than 24 months after operation. Only two infants had congenital malformations, none died perinatally."
"2";"After many cycles of weight loss and weight gain, more and more morbidly obese patients undergo bariatric surgery, like gastric banding or gastric bypass, as the ultimate treatment for their obesity-problem. Since women of reproductive age are candidates for bariatric surgery, concerns arise regarding the potential impact on future pregnancy. English-language articles were identified in a PUBMED search from 1982 to January 2008 using the keywords for pregnancy and bariatric surgery or gastric bypass or gastric banding. The few reported case-control and cohort studies clearly show improved fertility and a reduced risk in obstetrical complications, including gestational diabetes, macrosomia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in women after operatively induced weight loss when compared with morbidly obesity women. The incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) appears to be increased, however. No conclusions can be drawn concerning the risk for preterm labour and miscarriage, although these risks are probably increased compared with controls matched for body mass index. Operative complications are not uncommon with bariatric surgery and several cases have pointed to the increased risk for intestinal hernias and nutritional deficiencies in subsequent pregnancy. Deficiencies in iron, vitamin A, vitamin B(12), vitamin K, folate and calcium can result in both maternal complications, such as severe anaemia, and fetal complications, such as congenital abnormalities, IUGR and failure to thrive. Close supervision before, during and after pregnancy following bariatric surgery and nutrient supplementation adapted to the patient's individual requirements can help to prevent nutrition-related complications and improve maternal and fetal health, in this high-risk obstetric population."
"3";"Improvement in Type 2 diabetes is seen in 80-98% of obese diabetic patients who undergo gastric bypass or bilio-pancreatic diversion. This improvement is evident early after the operation before significant weight loss has occurred. Although numerous teams have extensively studied the physiology of this early post-bypass amelioration of type 2 diabetes, the exact mechanism of diabetes remission remains unclear. Studies have focused on changes in the entero-insular axis, which is mediated in part by the interaction of insulinotropic hormones GIP and GIP 1 on the beta islet cells of the pancreas. Other mechanisms which have been postulated focus on the adipo-insular axis; the actions of adiponectin and leptin seem to have an important role in insulin resistance but their action is weight-loss dependent. Post-operative caloric restriction may also contribute to the early resolution of type 2 diabetes observed after gastric bypass and bilio- pancreatic diversion."
"3";"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SH) is a frequent metabolic complication of bariatric surgery. Around 70%of patients who undergo biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) have this complication in the long term. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative influence of vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption in the development of SH in patients who underwent BPD. We reviewed the mean values of PTH throughout the post-operative follow-up and of related biochemical data (25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, magnesium) of 121 patients who underwent BPD at our institute from November 1996 to November 2004 (mean follow-up 66 months). Mean PTH correlated negatively with mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r=-0.27, p=0.003) and with urinary calcium(r=-0.19, p=0.047), and positively with age (r=0.22, p=0.018). However, a high mean PTH was found in 48.7% patients with mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D >or=30 ng/ml and in 80.0% patients with mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D between 20 and 30 ng/ml. The mean PTH was normal in 5 patients without calcium supplements at present, and progressively increased in parallel to the calcium dose in the rest of patients, although mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not related to the calcium dose. Our data suggest that individual differences in active and/or passive calcium absorption determine intractable SH after BPD in around half of the patients who have normal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and in 80% of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 20 and 30 ng/ml after BPD, worsening with age."
"2";"Bariatric surgery is increasingly becoming an option for the treatment of morbid obesity. Patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery have varied post-surgical complications which present acutely in the emergency medical setting, particularly internal hernias. It may be difficult to identify an internal hernia in the absence of intestinal obstruction. This article will review the various types of imaging presentations to highlight the complexity of making a radiographic diagnosis. Recognition of internal hernia as the cause of intermittent or acute abdominal pain symptoms in these patients in the emergency setting can prompt immediate surgical intervention, thus avoiding life-threatening outcomes."
